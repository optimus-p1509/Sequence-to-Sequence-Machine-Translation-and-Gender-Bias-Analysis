Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran &apos;s destabilising measures in the Middle East .
The meeting should also , however , address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that we are discussing .
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington criticises Israel &apos;s continued settlement of settlements and is presenting Netanyahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
The deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , which the Obama presidency has put forward , has further worsened relations between the two .
In March , Netanyahu made a controversial speech at the Republican invitation to the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an affront to Obama .
The speech was not agreed with Obama , and a meeting was rejected by the Israeli authorities , pointing out the forthcoming election in Israel .
In an emergency call , Professor has been shot dead by his girlfriend .
In an emergency call , Professor Shannon Lamb , with a somewhat treacherous voice from the police , told him that he shot his girlfriend and that officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; is still alive and probably excited , and he said that family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
Within the House , the officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a manuscript that was cried on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman ever to love me &quot; , according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no evidence that Lamb , who was teaching in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , Ethan Schmidt , on the doorstep of his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
He said that Lamb had made the disastrous emergency call at some point afterwards .
There was another death before the end of the day : Lamm took life when the police took him in .
One day after university sheikhs , forcing students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what is motivated by Lamb .
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state , as well as by what students and staff who knew him knew , helped to paint a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher .
Students said that they were happy with his teaching .
The police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal prehistory .
Mr Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching unit includes 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
At the same time , there were some inclinations to deal with problematic behaviour .
A student , Brandon Beavers , who praised the Lamb , said that he seemed a little upset and nervous , &quot; as if something wrong with him . &quot;
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for health reasons , saying that he had some health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in university employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not provide him with a guarantee of an automatic way to recruit as an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he had no idea of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lamb &apos;s imagination . &quot;
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
After the escape from the campus , the police later found Lamb Spur when he again invaded Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed a 438 caliber gun in the back yard of a house , about a mile south of his parent &apos;s house at the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson .
His car was still in the entrance .
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this House , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy .
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring .
One of Lambs &apos; longtime friends described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said that she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when she met with friends .
They and their friends were in high school and he was the cool old guy who tried to teach her the guitar for a couple of years .
He was the women ’ s shy at the time .
All girls melted in that time when he was there , &quot; said Hairston , 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together .
In the emergency call , Lamb said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had a dog called Lightning , who lived with them in the brick house , which borders on a Bayou in Gautier .
The police said that the dog was in order .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O &apos;Steen , said that they were forcibly forgone 15 years ago , but that they had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; She was totally destroyed &quot; , said O &apos;Steen about his daughter .
They and their mother were absolutely the best friends .
O &apos;Steen said he never met Lamb , but his daughter Abigail heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues .
Lamb made a point when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer millenium three years ago .
Later they played together the one or the other .
O &apos;Steen said that his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse working online for various companies .
Mike Shaffer , a bohemaker and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a weak bar near Gautier , said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night last night at night 5 September after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica pick-up before a scarce public .
There were no signs that anything was wrong .
&quot; Just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
We were on the up and smiled .
I think they both had a good sense of joke .
The first semester seminar , Schmidt , led the first semester seminar and specialized in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
He was married and had three young children .
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
On Tuesday evening , on Tuesday evening , some 900 people attended a candlelight commemorative ceremony on the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lecturers , employees , students and members of the community .
Schmidts Mrs Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache , while the University Choir &quot; Bright Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
The course will resume on Wednesday .
&quot; We are trying to get our students back , &quot; said LaForge .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb has called the emergency call after he shot Schmidt and that Lamm , in his emergency call , called Prentiss , who called him his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us is planning to stop working fewer hours of work for Christmas time .
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas saxon employees as last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed there a chance to work more hours .
The company said that 40,000 people were employed in shops and distribution centres throughout the country , and that the number of workers employed in the Christmas period was 45 000 .
Most jobs will be part-time jobs .
The company said that it will start this month with interviews and that the number of employees will increase from October to December .
Christmas is a long way away , while the holidays are months away , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to provide shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Fox is a &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana .
The premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
It was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; We sat in the theatre waiting for the Royals , and I realize that the seat is empty beside me and I am beginning to realise that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary film Back in Time .
The film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated paralysis and an arc length of being with the Princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; Back in Time &quot; , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; , presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg .
&quot; Back for the Future &quot; was premiered 30 years ago .
&quot; It really is for me , &quot; Spielberg said , &quot; the greatest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; Back in Time &quot; will be shown on VOD , DVD and selected cinemas in October .
The UN boss says that there is no military solution in Syria .
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; There is no military solution to the conflict , which has lasted for almost five years , and more weapons will only make violence and misery worse for
The UN chief is again calling on all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban said on Wednesday , a press conference on Wednesday , that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - at the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &apos; make this situation insoluble . &apos;
Ban asked five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria as they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 surveys showing that Donald Trump is serious .
Some have tried to brand it as a flop .
Others have dismissed him as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But , no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in surveys , it has not ( yet ) worked .
Ten of the last eleven national surveys have been the subject of a double-digit spread , and some are beginning to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nominating the property moguls .
Of course , it is too early in the parliamentary term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain , none of whom even won a single government in the nomination process .
There are many reasons why he should fight in a general election .
But outside parties like Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the Conservative Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump ’ s perseverance and starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
Here are some recent survey figures , which indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase :
Trump ’ s popularity ratings turned 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a survey by Monmouth-University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the Real Estate Mogul positively .
By mid-July , it was 40 % .
At the beginning of August , it was 52 % .
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
And these figures are in the early states .
A quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week noted that 60 % of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two thirds of GOP-voters GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate .
In a recent poll by CNN / ORC , 67 % of Republicans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Trump was nominated .
Only two out of ten say that they would be &quot; angered &quot; if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson creates the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 % say that they are &quot; enthusiastic &quot; ) , 40 % say the same about Trump .
Next on enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 % .
On the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they are &quot; dissatisfied &quot; or &quot; angered &quot; if Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , becomes the candidate .
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump &apos;s temperament as a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements , 52 % of the Republicans who are Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same figure is in the first state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief , Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 % think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively , and almost six out of ten independents say that his temperament is not fit into the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put up their own law , Republican voters consider Trump to be real .
When asked who is the most likely to win the GOP nomination , after a poll by CNN / ORC last week , four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change since the time when four out of ten of them were spending their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July .
Full disclosure : GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At that time , in the last cycle , four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28 % for the final candidate , Mitt Romney .
Yet it turns out that a large number of GOP voters consider Trump ’ s campaign plausible .
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate , Trump is still nearly everyone .
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump ’ s leadership , while anti-trust support is spread diffuse on more than a dozen other candidates .
But a Monmouth-University survey at the beginning of September shows that Trump , in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates , is winning the majority support .
Before Carly Fiorina , he has 13 points in front of him , 14 points before Marco Rubio 14 points , 15 points before Walker , 19 points before Jeb Bush , and finally , before the rim Paul , John Kasich and Chris
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate to propose him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans said they had formed their minds .
A new CBS / NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the electorate supporting Trump says they have voted their votes firmly .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say that they will never change the mind .
46 % said that they left the door open to change to other candidates .
Trump is , however , the strongest competitor at the moment , the neurochiatric Ben Carson , but voters who say that they have formed their minds are twice as often for Trump .
Six out of ten Republicans say that they are in agreement with Trump on the issue of immigration .
Since Donald Trump , in his election campaign two months ago , called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rapists &quot; , immigration has been the key point in the public discourse on 2016 .
Some are concerned that Trump &apos;s bombastic language will keep the Republican Party out of the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation effort .
But , according to Monday &apos;s new ABC / post poll , six out of ten Republicans say that they are in line with Trump on immigration issues .
So long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Trump appears to be doing so .
The frustration with the government is climbing up to new heights .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their outsiders &apos; status .
Six out of ten Republicans say in the new ABC / Post Monday poll that they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience .
And they are also angry with Washington .
A poll by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress , with 54 % &quot; dissatisfied &quot; and 21 % &quot; hostage-like &quot; .
Munich , Sylt and Co . : Die fünf exklusive Wohngegengegengegenschaften Deutschland ( The Netherlands ) .
Here in the Hobooken way is the most expensive residential area - with views over the North Sea Watt .
On the road , a square metre of a living room house costs € 73,300 .
&quot; Sylt is , of course , limited in terms of the supply of objects , &quot; says the study - that is , the high price .
A new study shows the special locations of a square meter at the most .
Of course , EUR 18.70 per square meter for a student book in Munich is not very little .
Unlike Germany &apos;s top living standards , the price is like peanuts .
The real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters of flats in staggering heights .
There are several tens of thousands of euro nox - per square metre - well worth noting .
But who can afford it ?
By the way , Munich is not the top one , for once .
Champions League : Bavaria ’ s dream start thanks to Müller and Götze .
Twice a head in Piräus : Bavarian star Thomas Müller has just run a course .
A happy match from Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to win a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it ran .
A sovereign start of the Champions League season .
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a start to the &quot; mission Milan &quot; in the Piräus mountain range .
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their event in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers ’ double pack ( 52 / 90 + 2 ) and Götzes ’ s hits ( 89 ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The twelfth time of the run-up in series is to be the first step towards Finale in Italy on 28 May 2016 , where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received amicable support from Olympic champion Roberto , who was the flip-face of the World Champion , at his 28th match in the champions &apos; League for the Bavarian Leadership .
&quot; We will not underestimate them &quot; , Bavaria captain Philipp Lahm promised before the match at the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich manager said it .
They showed a concentrated and committed vision , without glossy .
Piräus had won his last six championship titles , including the famous clubs such as Manchester United , Atlético Madrid , and Juventus Torino .
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stumbled upon this .
But Bavaria , in seven Europacup-duels with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They went courageously , but they often made ingenious attempts in their offensive efforts .
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the focus on left-wing banks Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through against former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui .
Müller was lucky to have done more than his flank from the right half of the toe in the upper left corner of the toe .
In the 67 minute World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski .
First , when Olympic champion Ideye Brown beat Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
Then by direct debit , Torwart Roberto partook with the knee ( 35 . ) .
Although Bavaria had its usual dominant game , Piräus could set needles .
But it was a forgiving on Torhütte Manuel Neuer .
This is how he steered a shot of Ideye over the lame ( 56 ) .
Before a new man , Guardiola allowed a four-legged chain with David Alaba to defend the centre alongside Jerome Boateng , who did it well .
Mario Götze , after Muslim problems back in the cadet , sat outside .
The winner of the World Cup was only after the final training , and the athlete Matthias Sammer said in the &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; Those who want to do something different from this are already malicious . &quot;
Guardiola also opted against him at the first round when he brought Kingsley Coman to the devastated Lewandowski ( 59 ) .
Götze arrived late for Arturo Vidal ( 76 ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with Elf , Müller still put one on top .
Before the match , the stadium was in a state of riots .
After a smaller group of partially suspected Bavarian fans appeared to provoke words and gestures in their observer ’ s block , the supporters of the host of the hosts intervened and attacked the Munich supporters with headwinds .
At least one Bayern-Fan was injured in the stadium .
If you smoke , you risk losing teeth .
Whoever smokes does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study of Potsdam .
The good news : if you do not take it , the risk will drop quickly .
Smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
This is due to the long-term study of an international research team , including several staff members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared to non-smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 fold .
Scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants .
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammation of the tooth , emphasized by DIfE .
For these periodontitis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
The link between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent cases of tooth infections in smokers .
It is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of caries .
People who stopped smoking could , however , reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research .
It may take more than ten years , however , to bring the threat to non-smokers again , explained Erstautor Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England .
They have to convince people to become non-smokers , explained the head of the DIFE , Heiner Boeing , who said : &quot; Smoking cuts the life span &quot; .
Not to smoke is good for the lung and the vessels and , as we know , it also leads to good tooth health and to an early age .
In Germany , over 20 % of the population aged between 65 and 74 years of age have been affected by toothlessness , informed DIfE .
Previous research has already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss .
The new long-term study reinforces the findings .
Archaeologists are coming across the Rhine uplands on the Rhine upland .
Once again , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
Archaeologists from the Roman and German Museum excavated skeletons and remnants of historic buildings near the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , and the museum manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
Since the construction work on the Rhine began , historians have been searching for so-called natural monuments .
The museum is always used as a specialist in archaeological preservation of the soil in all buildings in Cologne .
Archaeologists have now been given the opportunity to study in the third stage of the Rhine Boulevard .
It has already been known from text documents that in the place of the 4th century a fortress and a church were laid down in the 8th century , and Trier explained .
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with some 350 tombs , which was probably part of the church .
Young woman of freight
After a young woman has been injured at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern , the Federal Police is asking the people to help .
On the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m. the woman crossed the railway station from the station at the end of the railway and was covered by a freight train from the direction of Mönchengladbach .
By collecting the train , the Bundespolizei has been carrying heavy injuries .
She was treated on the spot and was taken to hospital by rescue personnel .
The officials who are investigating the young woman are not aware of the reason for the young woman &apos;s night crossing .
The incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions .
The question arises for residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn , Ziegelbäckerweg , Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße ( L364 ) .
Information about the cause of the accident can be made available under 24-hour and free telephone of the Federal Police under the telephone number 0800 / 6888000 or any other police station .
The Commission is proposing new court cases in dispute over the closure of the IP IP .
In order to defuse the dispute over the proposed transatlantic Free Trade Agreement with IP , the Commission proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system .
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which is much more traditional in its operation .
&quot; We want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; said the EU Commissioner responsible , Cecilia Malmström .
The Swedish Presidency intends to table the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
The German Government announced support .
By holding IP , the world ’ s largest free trade area with 800 million people is to be created .
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures provide concrete evidence that the EU Member States and the United States together select independent judges for a new investment court .
They should be equally distributed from the EU , the USA and third countries .
For the first time , the first instance is also a second instance .
It would allow opposition to be brought to justice .
Until now , the parties involved agreed on referees , there was no possibility of objecting to their judgments .
It has become clear in the discussion over the past few months that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in fairness and justice , Mrs Malmström .
In the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court , according to its own information .
This would also allow , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
The investor State arbitration procedures ( ISDS ) , which are required mainly by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for Europe &apos;s strong opposition to &apos; lie IP &apos; .
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers , undermine national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
In the first positions , anti-trust IP organisations such as Campact regarded the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient .
It was criticised in particular that they should not apply to the negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( Ceta ) .
The German economic State secretary , Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a major step forward .
The Commission takes into account important points in the reform which were prepared by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sigmar Gabriel , with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
The old system of private arbitration is from the table .
The French Government also welcomed Malmström &apos;s plans .
The European company BusinessEurope warned against restricting the opportunities for business to take action by imposing too many new rules .
This could put small and medium-sized enterprises in particular at a disadvantage , as it was .
When the talks on the free trade agreement ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
The negotiations have been going on since mid-2013 .
The issue of investor protection has , however , not yet been discussed with the United States .
The original agreement was to be in place by the end of this year .
This date is no longer tenable .
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg , Germany
Eleven years ago , Sufjan Stevens is on stage in the Prime Club of Cologne ( today : Luxor ) .
Besides he is a flipchart , on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with a cinematic pen .
The whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stevens &apos; talk .
He tells the story of his minutiae and delicate arrangements , and he tells the story of his songs .
Where they came from and what it looks like there is their home .
Since then , Stevens has been a wonderful creative irritant .
The 2003 and third album &quot; Greetings from Michigan : The Great Lake State &quot; , released in 2003 , makes it seem that the songs that were produced intelligently were very close to American folk-songs of late sixties , but that they could at any time be
The rumour is emerging that &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a wedge : each of the 50 US states would be called into question .
But already in 2004 and in the Rhineland-Palatinate area , Seven Swans has already appeared and is expecting some expectations .
Stevens is reduced here .
He is a guitar and banjo .
A year later , the musician living in New-York returns to the series .
With &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Sufjan Stevens Invites You To : Come on Feel The Illinoise &quot; ) , a masterpiece of a whole series of events will be published in 2005 .
It is a matter of ideas and stylistic finesse .
The album is rising in the American Billboard charts and is not missing from the list of the influential music media .
After very productive experiments , Stevens then uses very extensive electronic pieces of electronic parts on &quot; The Age of Adz &quot; ( 2010 ) .
This sixth regular studio album is still broadcasted in broad orchestras , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and reverb .
The stage shows are long gone from the smaller clubs to the colourful spectacle of neo-state-bands and the grand fluorescent stage engravings .
Currently Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-member band .
In the dark-kept hamburger More !
He mainly presents the &quot; Carrie &amp; Lowell &quot; , which has been available since March .
Although almost 2000 guests are now being held in their chairs , the stealth that has been much more mature is returning to intimacy and torture .
Without a single word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays by the broadly-enriched album .
The audience is told that the talk is &quot; opulent &quot; and that it can basically throw away the &quot; disk &quot; .
Stevens is only thankful for a grant , plays acoustically few older songs and finally hides under the applause of the album .
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s debut at the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time
Since his election , Mr Corbyn ’ s debutant has been eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time .
The new Labour President Jeremy Corbyn is due to be detained at the Prime Minister &apos;s Question Time and to start with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Corbyn will rise to put the first of his six questions shortly after midday , with his performance likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs looked at closely .
He called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
He also said that he could skip some of the meetings to leave them to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Corbyn &apos;s leadership , because he will come to the Shadow Cabinet after being appointed and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , Labour ’ s decision to remain in charge on Tuesday during the sinking of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony on the 75 anniversary of the Brussels of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several newspaper stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyn ’ s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention .
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had &quot; stood in respectful confidence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England &quot; .
But a member of Mr Corbyn &apos;s Shadow Cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two Newsagt program that he advised the Labour President to sing the national anthem , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve Mr Corbyn &apos;s top team , and they invoked differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary Party was originally a leader .
The Political Correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also &quot; stacking &quot; within Labour , following Mr Corbyn &apos;s comments about the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits .
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC that Labour is tabling amendments to remove the whole idea of a limit as a whole .
Hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow labor and pension minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the cap from $ 26.000 to $ 23 000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chair to be standing in front of Parliament in the last decade over the Dispatch Box , as David Cameron has been a Tory chief .
The Labour Chair , who promised a different policy approach , says that he has &quot; crowd-sourced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
The Islington North MP has said that Prime Minister Question Time is too confrontational and that it will not be able to resist both &quot; toughness &quot; and the dispute and instead has focused on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will be represented by him if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is abroad .
He also raised the idea that other colleagues should occasionally take the floor and that he raised the issue of John Bercow , the speaker of the House of Commons , in order to discuss the problem .
When he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics of a casual theatre policy , often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s Question Time , but a few years later he admitted that he failed to do so .
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the ruling and leader of the House of Commons and its position among its fellow Members , although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms .

Pound rises in the United Kingdom as a result of accelerated wage growth .
The pound rose to the tune of data showing a rise in UK wage growth , while the FTSE 100 was increased by the bidder SABMiller .
Between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % , compared with the same period last year .
This percentage has been the fastest and most recent estimate since 2009 of the time of an increase in interest rates .
The pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,5505 and was up to 0.84 % up against the euro at € 1.3730 .
The FTSE 100 index closed by 1.49 % to 6.229.21 .
SABMiller was the outstanding stock market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover bid by Rivalen AB InBev had been received .
A transaction would combine the world ’ s two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser , Stella Artois , Peroni and Grolsch .
Burberry stocks were 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the competitiveness group for Richemont .
Richemont ’ s latest sales figures are hitting all expectations and also showed that sales in China , a key market for Burberry , are again generating growth .
Glencore shares rose by 5 % after mining ritual said that it had taken 2.5 trillion dollars through share sales as part of its policy of reducing debt .
The Mondi packaging and paper group was the largest loser in the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Goldman Sachs &apos; s assessment of the rating of the company rating was &quot; selling &quot; .
JD Sports grew by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported pre-tax earnings of 46.6 million for the six months .
JD Sports ’ s boss says that higher wages endanger expansion .
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of its firm , he says .
The costs could be the expansion plans of JD Sports , added , and that could mean fewer additional jobs .
Justin Bieber in the capital : Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber , Megastar .
Late 21 years of age , a hanging with a superficial fly .
The type with the platinblonde hair is EUR 100 million .
Even more .
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin .
And the U17 generation is turning .
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska .
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name &quot; Ritz Carlton &quot; .
Not bad .
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday .
Under Ewa and Viktoria from Poland .
Since 7 a.m. in the morning , however , the police are sitting on the cold stone plates before the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz .
The Bieber-Bau : Here her Idol , whose poster hangs in Stettin , has been living since Monday evening .
The suite , which is home to the Canadian singer , costs exactly the same amount of money the day as her Mama Ewa deserves in the space of six months .
If anything .
It says : &quot; In fact , my wiktoria should sit in the tenth class in the high school . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her dream &quot; .
Liability for schooling ?
Who is it ?
The fans do not .
Even Bieber himself does not .
It has already been taken care of .
He received three million dollars for the advertisement in the advertising break of the Superbowl , a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company , many , many dollars on the Bieber account .
And every doll looks like him and goes over the ladder , Bieber also kills .
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the window window .
He is to have been saved more than 100 million .
Some say that the hype is too far away .
Others say that , in the United States and Britain , benchers are in fact the first to have their new single , &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to number one .
Bieber himself , whose fourth album will follow in November , is not interested in the many zeros for the first time .
At least it does so .
Pegida poster is a potato döner idea for Lebanese people .
Potatoes or Döner ?
It is both - and this is the potato döner , developed by the Oldenburg dynasty owner Hani Alhay .
Inspired by the saying &quot; Kartoffel statt Döner &quot; on a plaster of the Pegida movement , Alhay has put potato and meat together on a plate .
He was a poster on the idea at a Pegida demonstration , with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of Döner &quot; , which he accidentally saw on television .
Since then , a grill of barbecue has been turned into his shop , equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; That is multiculturalist for the stomach , &quot; says Alhay .
The idea has now been accepted by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich .
According to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
How much meat and how much of the potatoes contain the tables , therefore , does not want to betray Alhay .
It is just that : &quot; It tastes even better together &quot; , he finds .
The culinary understanding of nations is also good for its customers .
Metcash launches Sovereignty Campaign to Combat Allied Infrection
Metcash is trying to protect IGA planes from an Aldi run in South Australia and Western Australia .
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a Sovereignty Campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million Allied invasion .
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their ties with local food suppliers and build IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as ad hoc show .
IGA dealers and suppliers are stepping on board , with brands like ice cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough , distributing samples and shopkeepers selling cheap tickets for South Australian football leagues to faithful customers .
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September , when the wholesale for food , alcohol and equipment is carrying out its annual investment strategy day .
There is a lot at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 % of Metcash-based IGA retail deals and generate higher profit margins than the metric IGA network in the Eastern states .
Purchasing companies in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 % in South Australia and 24 % in Western Australia compared to around 14 % in the East .
However , analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that , twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Aldi will be cutting around 5 % of the food market in these two states and will take away sales to all existing players , but mainly to independent
According to a report published this week , the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and metric 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on metric high fixed costs could cost Metcash around $ 13 million in advance before interest and taxes , said Mr Kierath .
At the same time , Metcash ’ s market share is losing out in the Eastern states , mainly Aldi and Coles , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley estimates that metric sales in the food and food business will drop by 3.8 % in 2016 , 4.1 % in 2017 and 2.1 % in 2018 , and will reduce the market share from 14 % in 2015 to 10.3 % by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager , Hamish Douglass , the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , told a businessman in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade .
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass &apos;s comments .
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week .
Since 2010 , IGAs ’ market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 % , and earnings from metric meat and food trading , which provides around 1,200 IGA retailers , have fallen by 43 % since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction while complying with turnover and margins .
The wholesaler , however , is struggling to invest more than $ 150 million to bring up sales prices with coles and voolworths at hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster , growing fresh food and to provide better choice of private label food .
Metcash ’ s chief executive , Ian Morrice , says that price adjustments and retail relocation programs will be on the verge of being miserly , hoping that , in 2017 , the wholesaler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy .
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the &quot; collateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and , according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy , deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented Duos , is always called the Special Ks , and the notorious quartet of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka has brought it to the fore of the Montreal Masters .
In a fiery game of qualifying in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison were twice separated by the referee , Harrison declared : &quot; Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios and I should beat the child &quot; .
While he was last seen as he crushed a tennis racquet after a cramp thunderstorm a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet , he was steadfastly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Groth for second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK .
&quot; One thing I rather get more interested in is the fact that , in my view , Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute a little , &quot; said Healy .
He broke a thug when he lost to the US Open because of a tie , but he is not the first player to break a thug of frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he has behaved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves much credit .
He has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a little too strictly .
He is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the dressing area , he is training hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &apos; joint decision &apos; as the right thing for all , but he ensures that Canberra , a long-term permanent member , returns to the team .
&quot; First of all , we want the team to be fully focused on competition and not to all the controversies around &#91; Kyrgios &#93; , &quot; said Healy .
I believe that Nick has quickly made the ascent , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , and he is rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we are trying to support him , we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time outside the ramp light , which he can only think about , is the best way to make the team think , and it is
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency status , closes the border , keeps refugees back .
Hungary declares the state of emergency and suspended the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all those who tried to enter the country illegally , all with the aim of halting the influx of migrants .
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man &apos;s-land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation .
The people who had fled violence stuck up in a road strip on the road between the two countries &apos; checkpoints and built tents and settled there .
Frustration , however , increased .
When a police helicopter broke over them , the migrants sang &quot; open the border ! &quot; and insulted insults against the Hungarian standby police .
Some have returned food and water from protest .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
Talks with Brussels and other countries will have to be held in the coming days , &quot; said Ivica Dacic in Prague .
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border was not able to agree on a common immigration policy on a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
However , ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who have been seeking refuge in the overdrained Italy and Greece , expressing their hope that an agreement would eventually be reached - next month or before the end of the year - that the EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
On Tuesday , Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent ’ s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swift action by Brussels or its neighbours .
The emergency state of affairs in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
The Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter Szijjarto , meanwhile said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants by the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D &apos;Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia .
In recent months , Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted , however , that most of the incoming economic migrants are looking for a better life , not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany .
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or the damage of the 4-metre ( 13 feet ) high Zauns built by the government along the southern border with Serbia , which also establishes higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers .
&quot; Due to the situation that has arisen through mass migration , the Hungarian Government is declaring the state of emergency , &quot; said the government spokesperson , Zoltan Kovacs , in the southern town of Szeged .
We say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament still has to agree to the military operation , which is expected next week , but Associated Press reporters have seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on a daily basis .
Gyorgy Bakondi , Landes-security advisor for Orban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country .
They come out by shattering the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws .
Authorities are quick to repair the fence .
On Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia , after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders .
Chaos surrounded the main crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal shed to process people ’ s data and crowd a crowd to push for it .
About 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .
Electoral 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead before Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to make a two-digit advance in the democratic race to nominate at national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her .
Clinton has now 27 % support for 47 % of democratic voters in the pre-election ( 58 % before ) , while Sanders is second , with 27 % ( increase by 17 % ) .
Vice-President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency , receives support of 15 % of the democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates they will support .
But Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates .
Since the CBS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while Sanders has scored some gains .
Clinton has a big lead in women and moderates , but these advances have narrowed .
Their support for men has fallen significantly , and Sanders has only fallen 5 points .
Clinton ’ s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated , and they and Sanders are now on an equal footing .
Clinton , however , still has a big advantage among the older voters .
Last month , Clinton was in Sanders &apos; dual lead with the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
About half of the pre-election democratic voters nationwide say that if they were nominated by the party , they would support Clinton .
A quarter would support them with some reservations and a further 15 % would only support them , because they are the candidate .
Six percent would not support them .
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
The views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support them .
While 48 % of the pre-election democratic voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton , less Republican voters say this than their top candidate , Donald Trump ( 35 % ) .
When Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 % ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become President ( 13 % ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
Approval to dealing with the problems and the availability of voting are also quoted .
As the Vice-President is putting the presidency in a position to hold the presidency , 57 % of the democratic voters in the preceding elections want him to go on the radar - although one-third believes he should not .
When democratic voters are asked of the primaries , who is their second choice for the party , Biden is at the top .
More than half of the Clinton supporters say that Biden would be her second choice far away from Sanders .
If Biden decides not to stand for the nomination of the democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with beers in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure fell from 78 % last month .
Biden is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage he considers to be the most &quot; selective &quot; has risen .
Nevertheless , when it comes to what is more important in a candidate , Democrat voters are asking questions about eligibility .
Just as last month , no candidate for democracy or potential candidate for these voters is found unacceptable .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some important features of the voters of their party ’ s pre-election .
The majority view Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership .
Biden is best placed on the three candidates in honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about Sanders ( 15 % ) , but 27 % do not have an opinion on this .
Democratic voters in the primaries generally see Clinton , Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views .
In all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters do not have a view of Sanders .
Since questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being raised during the term of office as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views as
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement , while only about a third are satisfied .
Public opinion was divided on this in March , just after the problem came to light .
Most Americans have said that the controversy has had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general views , although 36 % said that their opinion had deteriorated .
It is mainly Republicans , more than six out of ten who say that their views on Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party , this remains a problem for her among elected voters : only 32 % see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the electorate do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 % of the electorate in the country also sees Trump as not honest and untrustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , receive good marks in leadership .
Biden , Carson and Bush are best off with honesty from the six candidates who have been tested .
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest , but , like Carson , many have no opinion .
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the run-off elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson is coming close to Donald Trump at a nationwide poll .
Ben Carson is in the latest CBS News / New York Times poll behind Donald Trump .
The two candidates now account for half of the electorate &apos;s support in the new poll , and others are losing dramatically .
Republican voters continue to support large numbers of Trump nationwide , and the 23 % support in the latest CBS survey conducted before Fox News last month was 27 % in the poll held on Tuesday .
But Carson shot from 6 % to 23 % over the same period .
The survey also showed that Carson is good for demographic groups and that Trump is outperforming university graduates among Republican voters .
The rest of the field , with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kaen , has been beaten up with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen to the lowest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio , is at 6 % in third place .
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
The latest CNN / OR poll published last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he landed 19 % support with the Republicans , with 32 % backing behind the Trump .
The latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump well before Carson .
Looking back on a Carson who was up in the last week , Trump found some sidewalks for the former neurosurgeon , even after Carson apologised for questioning Trump &apos;s faith .
&quot; We need energy , &quot; Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa .
Pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm .
Even if peak values are only measured in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find warm water .
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short time at a maximum of 17 degrees .
Some people are no longer on the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea is 18 degrees higher this week , divided by the German Weather Service ( DWD ) .
Bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it reaches as much as 29 degrees .
In the Adriatic , it is at the tip of 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
Five members of the Brotherhood have been burdened with the death of a Baruch college newcomer .
Almost two years after a student died during a barbaric ritual in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people are filed .
Members of New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun &quot; Michael &quot; Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which helped his death , told the police .
Civil servants said he was heavily burdened with a 30-pin backpack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field .
Mr Deng eventually complained about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to hospital , so the police .
However , they had the time to change Deng &apos;s clothes , to google his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; At this point , the members began to hide Utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng , &quot; said Polisignef Wagner .
He could not be revived , and he died of his injuries the next morning .
After an autoimmune report , Deng was repeatedly inflicted on head , throat and sling with stubborn force .
&quot; Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood , at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fierberg , a lawyer representing Dengs &apos; family .
Brotherhoods and their members must be brought to justice , and this step by the authorities is very important .
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for the first five members of the Third Reich .
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Meng , are also charged with harassing attacks and forming a criminal organization .
&quot; We do not just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization which has sanctioned - officially or unofficially - this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its membership of the local community .
This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates .
A rise in interest rates will come , and the house will be in ruins , bond yields will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
We know that .
What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
In particular , history for the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed .
A recession occurred within 11 months of the first increase in interest rates and lasted 86 months .
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve when it comes to raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the way in which the economy and financial institutions react .
That is why US Federal Reserve officials have so strongly emphasised that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normalization .
Indeed , several variables are involved .
In the end , however , market participants might find that the whole excitement over raising interest rates has been exaggerated .
&quot; The first step the Fed has raised since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jessop , Chief Economics at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
By contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at a low level to lead to seismic shocks that many seem to fear .
This does not mean that there will be no impact .
Here is a historical trend based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
As the market saw last month , anticipating interest rates can make things volatile for a while .
As soon as the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; There seems to be a tendency to devalue wealth returns 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy again , &quot; said German bank analysts in a recent study of what is happening after interest rate hikes by the Fed .
More specifically , the market has been in the upward trend in the last 35 years - about 14 % - on the way to raising interest rates , quite flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 % ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with average return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 % according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll , chief asset strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , at Barron &apos;s , with a recent analysis of Bob Doll ,
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on equities tends to occur later in the cycle of increase and that the return on yield begins to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often encourage them .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
It is very noteworthy that GDP will be close to its lowest point in the Fed interest rate hike .
According to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950 have been the figure of below 4.5 % in nominal GDP only twice since 1950 .
Although the second quarter was 3.6 % in 2015 , few expect this to continue and only 1.5 % expect the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Crises in interest in such a fragile economic context could be risky and raise the question of whether it is different this time , ” said Deutsche Bank .
Market participants have been lobbied by the Fed at a rate hike the whole year and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in this session , futures trading is only 25 % probability .
&quot; In our study , all increases in increases from 1950 to today have been conducted in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession levels have been dwindling very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; the report states .
By contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and that is 74 months .
The fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market .
The main difference is that bond effects are faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
In the case of bonds , returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
At the end of the increase cycle , bond yields fall immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
Charles Schwab &apos;s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a situation in which returns between longer and shorter bonds will converge and lead to a curve being bottomed out .
Higher-yielding bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cautious about expecting higher yields &quot; , said Kathy Jones , Fixed-Income Analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
What is interesting , Jones says , is that the markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations .
&quot; Besides the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , credit has increased , and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens up its strategy .
By and large , companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit from increasing interest rates and making local products more attractive .
Big debts of multinationals will be worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive in the global marketplace , as will the financing of their debts .
&quot; History shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after initial interest hikes , &quot; Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers .
Companies with a strong record have exceeded companies with weak balance sheets by 5 percentage points on average , after each rate hike in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
Firms with high capital yields and low volatility in their equities also covered their low-quality counterparts by , on average , 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt will be a big problem .
Companies with a high level of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Goldman .
Outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see gains from higher yields , even if experts disagree on how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew Bingham .
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its &apos; stupid &apos;
He argues that he is increasingly not distinguishable from commercial rivals .
He also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they were only Imni .
Members of Parliament Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something that private broadcasters do not do .
The conservative Member , Andrew Bingham , also told the BBC bosses that public radio broadcasting is &quot; stupid &quot; and that it is increasingly no longer distinguishable from his commercial competitors .
&quot; Radio 3 does not like to use the word &quot; to dump &quot; - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which began last year , appear to be The Brits only under a different name .
So if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples , you are actually just imitating what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr Bingham .
BBC Director-General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness .
What I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed .
&quot; And Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and to commissioning new works is , I think , really important , &quot; he said .
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it was harder to work harder to get the public involved than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
Radio 3 , however , was not the only element in BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture , Media and Sport to put commercial rivals on the feet .
Tory MEP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and does not have a particularly striking influence ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in special BBC-style .
He added that he wanted the company to &quot; find a hit from our own stables &quot; when it was next time a series of entertainment started .
He refused to exclude the order of further rows from The Voice in the future or to spend money on other enterprise-class entertainment formats .
Internet sales have slowed in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
In the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent growth in online sales .
Last month , the lowest result was recorded in 2000 ,
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop .
Experts believe that in November Black Friday has held back the spending .
For more than a decade virtual shopping has been blowing , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating , with new figures showing just 7 % in the first three months of 2015 .
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the start of the recordings in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating , with new figures showing just 7 % growth in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; If you look at the growth rates for the years before 2000 , then this has always been the case over time , &quot; said Andy Mulcahy , editor of the IMRG sales index , the Guardian .
He explained that three years ago online sales increased when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phone .
It meant that more people could shop online and people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
But this is now happening and we may see growth going down .
The black Fridays phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the falling turnover .
Experts believe that buyers will withhold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year , five times the average number of purchasers around their computers crashed to make their bargains , and some vendors ’ websites crashed .
Experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bargain , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that something more than 1 £ was spent online by 5 £ .
Some products , such as TVs and washing machines , now run over one-third of the purchases via web shops .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried the Mecca in the Crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is being punished .
The bodies of 29 dead are driven by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia is partly responsible for the collapse of the huge Sauge Bin-Laden group .
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crash had collapsed .
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane was collapsed to Mecca &apos;s Great Mosque .
Searing , largely dressed , filled the course to show respect for the first of the dead when the first of the dead entered the al-Moaissa cemetery .
The funeral proceeded at the Saint , where only days before a builder crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bedding .
The bodies were released for funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family building company for the disaster , which left 394 injured .
The bodies of 29 servants killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets .
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the Kran fell .
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddock in the Great Mosque .
Saudi officials have already stated that the Hadads to Mecca will continue with thousands of people who will continue to come to town .
Today , King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have ceased the clan ’ s arm when it was not used .
An Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi government has said that the Bin-Laden group is jointly responsible for the collapse .
The English language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s management was banned from abroad .
Earlier this week , Salman was accused of disgust as to the fall of the Krans , which plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddy that later this month .
The Bin-Laden group did not say anything about the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
The Royal Decree also applied the group for non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists .
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca ’ s Great Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden group .
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
The late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a dissident son who was taken from the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
The crash of the killers came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for pilgrimages , which is needed at least once in every healthy Muslim .
Civil servants said that 158 people remain in hospital .
Government officials ordered 1 million rials ( £ 174.000 ) to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries .
Other injured will receive half that amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over .
British people are increasingly occupying craftsmen , Veronique Laury says .
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has been growing behind the scenes .
This will result in 200 more Screwbone shops being opened on craftsmen .
At the same time Kingfisher 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets will close nationwide .
By Rupert Steiner , City Chef-correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that British people are laying down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
If you can skilfully deal with a hammer or brush to remove walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
British people are increasingly employed by craftsmen to carry out homework jobs in their homes , as the company &apos;s boss , B &amp; Q , is doing .
Véronique Laury , new Chartered Director of Kingfisher , who owns the building site , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftspeople from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has meanwhile been superseded
Kingfisher is therefore planning to open 200 more Screwfix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales offices of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Laury said that she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q-shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the shop are taken by women .
At the moment , the men are outperforming the men .
She said that it is necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which are doing more renovations than they have in the past .
Mrs Laury said : &quot; It still works a majority of men in our stores .
We must move this more towards a balance .
In principle , half of our women are women with 80 % of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
Women play a major role in the decision-making process .
Mrs Laury , who is one of only five women at the head of a leading global leader in the FTSE100 index , has also been implementing her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in managerial positions .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 % of the team with women , including its management and financial board .
Mrs Laury said : &quot; This was a deliberate choice - diversity is an important issue here .
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
Kingfisher reported a drop in the half-year profit and sales , after the group was responsible for the cost of closing down the shops .
Because of the trend , Kingfisher , which has Screwfix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
Officials of Aich / Dob for infidelity to the Court
On Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-erial champion Aich / Dob have had to answer for infidelity and deductions .
The accused did not know who was guilty .
One of them was also charged with abuse of power .
He was acquitted of this accusation in May .
The current process has been postponed .
According to the Attorney-at-Law Professor , Robert Riffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the accused used funds from associations of associations over which they were permitted to conduct their functions for private purposes between 2006 and 2011 .
The damage is estimated at around EUR 400,000 .
The sports officials are also charged with financial offences .
This is a fact that the chairman of the spokesperson , Judge Michaela Sanin , ruled out .
It is to be negotiated at a later date .
In order to be blamed for the lack of faith , the defence was that the club was never given any compensation .
The sports officials would have only paid off expenses and the sports club , which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , would have been paid out of the debt - the passiva had around 600,000 schillings in 2001 ( around EUR 44,000
&quot; We faced the situation at the time : whether we continue or block the club , one of the accused , in the brothel profession , the chief executive of the financial office .
He then decided , with his colleague and co-accused , to take on this task .
All risks .
&quot; We have made money , our life insurance policies are being raised by the bank , &quot; he said .
The association was agreed : they can manage the money freely , and only debts must be made .
Furthermore , if the compensation for expenses allowances is met , the payment of expenses allowances has been decided retroactively by 1991 .
That is why some of the expenses incurred were paid only years later , namely from 2003 onwards , as a plus on the account .
That is why the former observer explained what was happening , including flat-rate and not detailed accounting .
The accounts and bookkeeping books jointly administered the two defendants , the other accused said .
Why the club did not reveal the disbursements in detail , the judge asked .
The association did not care about financial management in detail , but it was important that only debt freedom was , the answer was .
When a civil servant initiated an investigation into abuse of power in 2011 , a sum of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association ’ s account .
Those were reproaches , the defendants said .
This securities account was named after the second defendant and , according to the statement , was not known to the club .
&quot; Why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
The respondents did not know this answer for a long time .
He then said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
If something had happened to him , nobody would have known about this money , the public prosecutor put it in the room .
The person who had been accused of being informed was informed , the functioner justified himself .
This transfer was formulated as compensation .
Why compensation ? , judge and prosecutor wanted to know .
The first accused of this statement stated that he had not agreed with this wording , because the association had never suffered damage .
But what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; with that you are all out of the tailor &quot; .
&quot; I asked a legal representative , &quot; he asked .
The official said that he had never paid a cent , he only calculated kilometres and salaries .
He has charged the club EUR 1,000 per month at the courts , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
The accused were not able to provide accurate documentation for the early years .
They were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything was judged to be correct , they said .
The second defendant also referred to kilometres .
All the fixes were made in cash , and he had to drive from his home town to the Bank to Bleiburg , he stated in his statement .
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the consultation of witnesses .
Hewlett-Packard is cutting another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three years of staff reduction that has been going on for three years , the computer giant will be cutting back on jobs in the company &apos;s division .
The positions of the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) are not over .
The US technology group is planning to dismantle the production of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate sector as part of its restructuring .
The company was announced on Tuesday to save costs of 2.7 trillion dollars ( 2.4 tonnes ) .
The move will result in a special burden of around 2.7 trillion dollars , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
The reduction of 55,000 jobs , which has been going on for three years , has not yet been completed .
HP accounted for some 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013 / 14 fiscal year .
On a daily basis , Hewlett-Packard stock yielded 2.3 % .
The company , which is large with the printing press , is currently dividing itself from the Californian Palo Alto : the computer and printing business is to be bundled even further into a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
Both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
A further disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have left Lenovo the second-largest PC manufacturer in the world .
In the third quarter at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 % .
Sales fell by 8 % to just under USD 25.4 .
The proceeds in 15 out of 16 quarters were thus reversed .
HP answers with a breakdown and massive job cuts on the industry &apos;s change .
The 76 year old company , led by Meg Whitman , has only recently responded to customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online .
Overall , Whitman ’ s restructuring plans envisage the reduction of some 55,000 posts .

24 % oppose the conflict .
Cooperation with the Syrian leader , Mr Baschar al-Assad , is opposed to 51 % of the total , 20 per cent would be in favour .
29 per cent of the vote was not possible .
Car : Second press day at the 66 IAA .
The fair will focus on networked cars , self-driving cars and electromobility up to 27 September .
After two press releases , Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66 International Automobile Exhibition on Thursday , entitled &quot; Mobility Connection &quot; .
The public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
The organisers of the VDA Auto Association are expecting about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
Röszke : Violence of violence on the Serbian and Hungarian borders
The Hungarian police have used Röszke Tränengas and water cannons against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border .
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik experienced the violence at the border control point .
He reported :
A group of refugees broke the line .
Behind the police line , a police line had formed and a water cannon was ready behind the police .
Forty to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to officials .
The officials initially set up Pfefferspray .
Then the police used Tränengas .
Much tear gas has been spilled towards refugees .
That dissolved the group .
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat .
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted .
Other refugees have collapsed in themselves and suffered from breathing space .
The press spokespersons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
Time to choose Interest Rate
The world is watching when the Federal Reserve meets two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision as to whether or not interest rates are raised for the first time in almost a decade .
A survey of 80 economists , questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half the last week that the Fed will do so now thinks that the Fed will stay a little longer and that interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.25 % .
It is an historic event because it is seven years since the Fed placed interest on NULL .
&quot; For the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel Ubide , Chief Executive Officer at the Peterson Institute for International Economics
The US economy is relatively well performing , trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and only low inflation .
However , the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions .
It has warned the markets to stop raising , but the indications suggest that the chances of such a move are good .
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday .
Defenders of Death at Delta State University left apologies for apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he was killed and killed his colleague later on - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; scared &quot; him at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could take it off , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday that he was not going to be able to take the prisoners .
The police in Gautier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and said he shot on someone and killed someone .
Lamb told the emergency office staff that police had to send police officers to his home .
He said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but that &quot; no one will disturb &quot; , but probably excited .
The police asked the caller for his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb did not make any explanation for his shots .
When police looked at the scene , they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a handwritten note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to undo it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman ever to love me . &apos;
After writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as a policeman .
University President William LaForge said he had no idea of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lamb &apos;s imagination . &quot;
Despite reports on Monday , which Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangular relationship &quot; .
The Prentiss was described by Shawn O &apos;Steen , who said that she was married for about seven years , as a good man .
The two were abandoned 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground &quot; .
He said that Prentiss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; .
Prentiss worked online from home , according to Linsday Knowles , identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss .
Knowles said that Prentiss , who owned a dog called Lightning , had met lamb for about three years .
&quot; She always wanted to help other people , &quot; Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them that &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
When policemen took him on the Highway 1 near Greenville later this night , Lamb drove his car , flew to the foot , ran into the woods , and killed himself with a shot .
In spring 2015 , Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University , as his pedigree quotes on the University ’ s website .
Stars that have lost their fortune
The actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Redmond ( right ) , had several stressful years .
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner , Farrah Fawcett , for cancer .
The actor is also alleged to be fighting drugs and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession .
All this certainly takes its toll .
Eurowings : Lufthansa is building up the Group
Lufthansa plans to restructure large companies .
The Lufthansa Group alone wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation .
150 of the world ’ s 1,000 executives will be able to relocate their workforce .
The pilot trade union is in the process of being renegotiated .
Lufthansa is building its business structure and is upgrading Eurowings &apos; low-cost carriers .
The aim of realignment was to generate a contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies , announced Wednesday by the airline .
In future , Lufthansa will not have any more management board for passenger services .
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the lead team of chief carsten Spohr .
The reopening highlights the importance of Eurowings , which will enable the Group to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future .
Up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the turnover of EUR 30 billion .
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective dispute with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to resume after the strike on the court this Thursday .
That was what the trade union was saying .
The subject of the discussions is the retirement scheme for pilots .
Cockpit &apos; in a year with a projected record result &apos; will soon be able to produce sustainable results .
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
The background is the &apos; Wings &apos; concept , alongside the pilot &apos;s transitional arrangements .
It foresees that Lufthansa will be outsourced to Eurowings , a group of companies in the fight against competitors .
Under the title &quot; Morning in the South &quot; paintings by Leena Krüger are to be seen in the Künstlerhaus .
The Finnish Finnish woman , who has been resident in Göttingen for a long time , has put together a selection of tireless works for the White House , which encourage her to travel on a journey .
Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months because of duplicated fracture .
Luke Shaw suffered a double fraction of his right leg in Manchester ’ s Champions League defeat at the PSV Eindhoven .
While this has brought the leftist defence race to the chest and will rule him out of play for at least six months , Louis van Gaal does not give the hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season .
The violation was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15 minute after the 20-year-old Shaw fell into the PSV field .
He was taken nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
Van Gaal said : &quot; He has a double beinfracture and is in hospital . &quot;
It will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and will then operate in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to have a very hard time and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
He woke up .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture , it will take six months and it will not be in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed lucky to escape a Red Card and the imposition of a elephant .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , did not punish the Mexicans .
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian arbitrator had mistaken .
You can judge for yourselves when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
It was a very serious attack with both legs .
A Tweet on Shaw &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages , but words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery is now beginning , I am coming back . &quot;
Referring to this , Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV .
The British Defender has an additional incentive to recover with the European Championship in France until next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV coach , said : &quot; It is a very serious injury . &quot;
If a player leaves the spot with this type of injury , they are all very sad .
It is never the intention of our players to violate an opponent .
Moreno suffered a breach when Mexico played against Van Gaals as the Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; He is very difficult because he was not his intention to violate the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very serious injury , that is not good , &quot; said Cocu .
I could not see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked as though he had touched &#91; Moreno &#93; him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
In the conversation with SBS6 , Moreno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very ill at it , and I am so sorry .
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to hospital - after a Foulplay by Chris Smalling .
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better ?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost exhausted .
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
When asked by a childcare provider to name his favourite child book , the Prime Minister chose The Lorax , the environmental fabel published in 1971 by Dr Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps website , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to read out to my children , because there seems to be always an image or a message that we have missed &quot; .
All well and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead reflects a content of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; In the midst of the converted city of Thneed-Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Audrey hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; says Dr. Seuss , whose real name was to be a real name , Theodor Seuss , whose true name was to be a hostage , but completely unknown to
As if this were not suspicious enough , the text presented by Cameron partially reads like the summary of the Lorax-movie , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website , and thus begins : &quot; In the converted city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Audrey hopes to win the girl of dreams . &quot;
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book &apos;s actions , and an unnamed boy listens to the local environment , as the money-hungry , sparing , thneekly , unsettled once-sister-ridden once-sister-ridden once-sister-ridden once-sister-ridden , saddened , tickling creatures &quot; talking
It is likely that such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row in one child .
A downing street spokeswoman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral district .
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron &apos;s staff had delivered the text , but did not make any further comments .
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England , but it is still difficult .
It is a difficult task to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , but if you see the Kader who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 test victory defeat is not on my card .
I would not rule out a victory .
Alastair Cook &apos;s side is probably less experienced than it was three years ago , but there are good spin-players in the battle panel , and the Community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any scars from 2012 , only a youthful positive attitude .
Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid with the ball , even if it is an unknown size on a test level , is an option for the attack .
This is the news : Adam Lyth is out of the England-Test-Kader and replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is , of course , difficult for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire .
There were two good attacks in difficult circumstances during seven tests , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are geared towards results .
There were no question marks about Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination , because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selectors .
Long ago , the course of Lyth would have been extended , but it had control over its own destiny .
If he is to be able to take out further runs for Yorkshire , another chance will come .
The English coach , Trevor Bayliss , praised his attitude , even though he did not perform such good work , and that does not surprise me ; he is , above all , a team-man .
The question of how much time a tester receives to set his mark is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out .
The only criticism that could be levelled at England was that England first deployed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in and he is a drummer , whom I value highly .
He is an X factor cricket player , which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored us at a Trent Bridge in 236 , which was a great deal to us .
It must at least have the same opportunities as before , but this naturally depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of having mosquitoes out of Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks , was a good idea and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a drummer cannot beat there , and those left-wing countries have already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricket players .
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no great difference .
My former colleague , Justin Langer , played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an Opener in 2001 .
He has done three hundred of his runs straight away and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari is in the box as a back-up butcher , and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me as a young man .
People may see their statistics - 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punt , but there is not a large number of back-up spinners who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the team , England has made a few wise additions to the training staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the Batsman of Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterstroke .
He is one of the most nice guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience to bear , as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful input into the setup .
I always felt that he was a champion of international cricket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit .
Sometimes new voices can be brought in the changing cabin , even if the news is in line with what has been said .
Collys ’ team colleague at Durham , Ben Stokes , is not being used by the one-dayers , and Root has had a similar break with Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
Some will not agree , but coaches and team members will not determine the timetable .
And you must remember that , like the players , their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions are not taken lightly .
The Brexit camp ( Brexit = UK exit from the EU ) could gain in acceptance if the economy were to become a flute by 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s unsophisticated renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be in trouble with each passing day , even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC , who is fiercely crushed by Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages .
A European diplomatic acquaintance recently said that some Member States , deeply entrapped in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always out of their own accord , are fed up with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes , which they do not usually want .
In Brighton , TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it jeopardises social protection .
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda .
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb up summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they are winning allies for reform .
It is always about me .
My European friend who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not just talk to France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go .
Germany ’ s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it looks bad for her , as happened with the excessively long extravagant such as Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande has a look at his re-election or replacement in 2017 .
It is also a fading force .
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government , Spain a left-wing one .
It is difficult to imagine that they will take off a leg to help the Self Brits , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separatist tendencies have similar tendencies .
Therefore , some of these ministers may even plan deliberately unhelpful remarks , in the SNP style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 , in order to speed up the Brexit process , is suspected of my friend .
&quot; The renegotiation was a bankruptcy &quot; and &quot; Britain has gained nothing from the renegotiation . &quot;
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be and what EU sceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
You can be a little bit reminded of Boris Johnson , the Euro-Euro-opportunist , who made a name as an &quot; EU Gerade-Bananas &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s .
In all his perseverance , Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
This included the Medley of tax hawkers , the expatriates of the telephone , and the pseudo non-Indians who hold most of our big newspapers .
Tony Blair thought it was a bit like her , but he said that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla , you would be better off distributing bananas to distract him , instead of being lunch and dinner .
Indeed , Miliband was more of a Blairian than Blair himself , when he opposed Cameron ’ s referendum wreath , because Blair had laid the principle over the EU Constitution that was not adopted , and was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , thereby opening a back door to him .
The press has never forgot it .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a friendly shot on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he would not waste any time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock &apos;s boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s , a mistake back then and now .
It may take time , but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyn &apos;s official position on Europe is - I say it kind of cheerful - in development .
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside Ukips , a traditional flower trend and the wild geese of Tory &apos;s mini-English can all say yes .
It is what Hilary &quot; A Benn , but no Bennite &quot; Benn said on radio and television this week , when the paddock fought in him not to admit that Corbyn &apos;s appointment as shadow chancellor was a bad idea as shadow chancellor .
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father was trying to be illoyal to his Labour colleagues on television without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
But to fight to remain &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Benns expresses - was not what McDonnell said , nor what JC told his fellow combatants and Members after all the reports at their polls on Monday evening .
Whatever the tiresome bottom-up image of Corbyn - remember that he even touched me - the era of TV is important in the era of TV and , above all , in the strudel of the social media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right that Cameron should not give Europe a free card , which allows him to consider Labour &apos;s support in the referendum campaign to be a matter of course , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyn ’ s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy , their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents , for whom narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is flatly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense for their superiors at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mistrustful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless ?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the cost of the Tor Government in power , something I was reminded of when I started on Monday by something called British Influence Security .
Experts criticise Public Health England &apos;s report on e-cigarettes
Researchers from a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some of them with the tobacco industry , said researchers .
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in its e-cigarette report .
PHE published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; .
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
A key article in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the &quot; extremely windy ground &quot; on which PHE founded its most important conclusion .
Two other researchers are writing in BMJ and asked whether the allegations are based on stone or sand .
Martin McKee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
They said that the public expects PHE to say that &quot; the best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; are based on a detailed verification of the evidence and modelling .
Indeed , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people called to develop a model for multidisciplinary decision analysis ( MCDA ) to synthesise their opinions on the damage caused by various nicotine products ; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health , whose managing directors were previously to have received an independent study from British American Tobacco ( BAT ) .
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that they would receive money from an e-cigarette manufacturer , but they did not add the funding that he was supposed to receive after reports from Philip Morris International , the tobacco company .
The reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not provided , but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions , some of which also provide industry funding in the paper .
Some other participants in this meeting are not aware of their expertise in tobacco control .
The tobacco management of PHE was also attended by the meeting .
The group &apos;s research &apos; is marked &apos; to say that there is a lack of &apos; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria &apos; , McKee and Capewell wrote .
However , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the Phare report .
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are a way to smoke for children or non-smokers &quot; have been premature .
Mr Kevin Fenton , Director of Health and Wellbeing at PhD , said that the BMJ &apos;s claims were already reacted .
He said : &apos; e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &apos;
Every second person who lives in life dies from his addiction .
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to that , but that we still have to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is evidence of evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks in relation to tobacco .
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two times .
By clearly stating that we are not without risk but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is present , we are fulfilling our national responsibilities .
BBC should give up EastEnders , says former head of Channel 4 .
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programmes like EastEnders and The Voice , saying that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK-based senders .
He criticised the BBC for placing public service programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in tough time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4 .
After the BBC Director-General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he had made no real effort to get in touch with the BBC during six years at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being commissioned or broadcast , which would also clearly be shown by non-subsidized rivals , &quot; Johnson said to the Oberhaus-Kommunikation Committee in his investigation of the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep broadcasting costs , which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least rely on programmes that do not or will not do other things .
They are sending The Voice in a first-class time window , because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future .
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is nonsense , of course .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a regressive tax is funding programmes that could also be financed without subsidies .
The Voice is such a program , and EastEnders is another , admittedly both self-produced .
To be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a serial businessman who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support &quot; .
His comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular television broadcasts reflect what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his 2003 MacTaggar lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders .
Johnson said that the more public-service Native Programs &quot; should go to BBC4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience quite well , but they are fulfilling their duties and they can argue when they go to their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £ of broadcasting , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them .
As regards radio charges , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions for which the best value can be obtained from this .
Of course , you all think that we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , I wonder if it is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
David Elstein , a former Skype and Channel 5 boss , who also said to the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission , &quot; inform , educate and entertain .
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example at public television channels in Australia and Canada to inform , educate , and maintain .
On the question of partnerships , Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms , which he said were only shown in a handful of television and with the commercial channels , to make alliances available online .
Sonogenetics can control brain cells by sound waves .
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with crank-motives , which have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
The impulses work by switching on cellular cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
More about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light light .
Researchers have said that the worms have shown the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researcher at Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep-brain stimulation , an invasive method that would give an electric impulse to people &apos;s brain to treat Parkinson &apos;s symptoms .
Fat spears do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani has found that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles .
The bubbles , he found out , reinforce the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
The amplified ultrasound waves are based on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the stem cells .
The sound waves are the opening of these channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , a report Nature Communications .
To create ultrasonic nematodes , Chalasani genetically modified worms to make some of their motoneurons carrying TRP-4 ion channels .
When applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are amplified by microblowers and transferred to the worms where they activate the modified motor vehicles .
The procedure has a number of similarities with Optogenetics , a ground-breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neurons to and off with light impulses .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
Unlike light , which must be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fibre , low-frequency ultrasonic tissue can pass freely and can thus be sent into the brain from the top of the skull .
&quot; We believe that gene therapy and therapeutic virus enable the human neurons to be temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in clinical settings for certain neurological treatments , &quot; says Chalasani .
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your door !
The ads are shameful Britain ’ s arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Arcane Video Video .
Sadly murderous drones !
Flowery browning of the brooks !
Streubombs !
And electric shocks that cause painful pain but leave no trace !
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this is a fierce parody produced by Amnesty International for the world ’ s largest arms trade , to bring to the fore the British Government ’ s willingness to arm weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExCeL Centre in Docklands in London .

But a separate campaign also leads to a lot of posters , which are to be seen at bus stops and in the underground trains , which require a second look .
&quot; Important : To get the DLR ? &quot; ( Docklands Light Railway ) from 15th-18 September , you can read in the books of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line , which converts to the image of a tank .
In September , a swarm of arms dealers will be running with the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help in stopping the arms trade show .
The 300 posters are artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksys Dismaland .
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute the London distribution and used &quot; Ad Space Hack Packs &quot; , a 6- pack of inbound keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one-third of the bus space advertising space on the planet is getting through &quot; .
Transport for London does not find this poisonous &quot; vandalism &quot; fun .
One of the parodie ads produced by Special Patrol Group .
According to Gavin Grindon , curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex , artists will become more critical and will try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
Many artists engage with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world outside , so that their art has an influence on society .
Another anti-weapons handles paper is greeting the commuters in the underground .
The Amnesty-Video was viewed over 100,000 times over Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , which works in a non-profit fashion with the graphic designer and voiceover artist , who works for free .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was surprised at the delay that prevailed around advertising for the weapons trade fair - a space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought : &quot; Let &apos;s give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . &quot;
They played with the invention of a more realistic , more realistic advertising , but &quot; by using bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Amnesty .
What we need now is for the British Government to intervene and for torture equipment not to be traded illegally on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art in the field of the arms trade is from the area within ExCeL , where exhibitors are fanning fantastic euphemistic products .

Eight golden rules for life in student residences
Eleven years ago , as a self-defeated 19-year-old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those I annoyed - and the numerous , long-lasting complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The entrance to student residences ranges from easy nerve-wrapping to absolutely terrifying .
It is tempting to sneak : people tell where you are from , whether and where you took Sabbath year , where you stand with Corbyn and why you , frankly Marmite , do not love or hate because in earnest , boys , it is only a Hefeextrat HAHAHA , I am in my room . &quot;
Breathe in .
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest .
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like to speak against those you would not speak to , even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers were on fire .
Let people .
People often turn themselves into drinks receptions , movie nights , events , and local meetings , but they are also the places where people get dressed up and get their underwear .
Referring to this : do not think about starting a relationship with the university .
Introvertised is given a rough treatment at the university .
Your room should be a refuge , but many student residences form a space to spatial pool culture , which is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship .
That may be hell for someone who tries to recover .
Nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to leave so I get back the energy I have used for interacting with you &quot; .
Try to see when a commintern is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of hitting it .
Add a word : do it .
A guy in my student residences had the idea that a door that was not locked was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Friendship is closing by baking .
As you start the uni at the height of the bakery , the monkey is less strange than the welcome of the 1950-year-old &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something , so please , and please smile if I ask you a few questions of a personal nature &quot; .
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends .
Your fellow citizens feel obliged to talk and eventually , in the end , they will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Bad flares from flour , sugar and fat are bad for people to sleep when you tap .
Standing food is a common crime in student residences .
Of course , the cloning of chickens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
Check with the dairy owner .
The chances are good that they are saying they are using themselves , even if they cook inside .
If someone steals your stuff , that is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my fellow citizens who added a leash to their milk to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
They should not make noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
It is not just a matter of being a decent person , but of being , in the truest sense of the word , one of the people sitting in the glass house .
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors whether it made them anything to put down Drum &amp; Bass a little more quietly , because it was three in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
They responded with even louder music .
When they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly left their neighbors sleeping two hours before they fleshed out their own music , shut down their doors and went to their three-hour exam .
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse were to be forced into the same student residence by chance ?
Conversely , it would not be absurd if you kept a fellow of your fellow citizens for your future spouses , took part in them , separated themselves and then saw them to see each other every day and perhaps see them as they were coming across all of their friends ?
Of course , the heart is going its own way - but if a hot fellow of you is definitely not your future marriage , try to get some sense of reason for your underbelly .
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room , the boundary between an ultimatum and bullying is fine than it seems .
A good stretch is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bumper .
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety through the cloak - but never forget your room with toothpaste and shampoo .
Close your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you then place in the freezer - but do not fix your possessions on the ceiling twice as hard as twice .
Semi-detached houses for refugees , single mothers , low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building townhouses in the centre of the Thuringian Corner of the Valley of the Neckar , for people who do not have much money .
So for refugees - but also as a signal : &apos; It is not just refugees who need a living room , but also the single mother and the low earners . &apos;
&quot; I show how we can still make cheap and good use of today , &quot; says the 44-year-old in the interview .
Thousands of refugees are going to be forced into the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes that it is possible to create a favourable housing situation quickly : he is building a multi-country home for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass shelter in containers or tower halls has no sustainability .
People remain here to a large extent .
In view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades .
A very banal , three-storey terraced house is the solution .
Guiltans : A row house needs the least space .
It facilitates integration .
This is not the case if people are housed in blocks of flats .
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers .
Each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many refugees will say that peace is back again , I will go back .
Then the houses can easily be adapted to suit the needs of each individual .
What is the cost ?
Guild : The price of 160 square meters of housing per house is 184 000 euros , without land .
That is easy to see .
It took six months to complete the construction .
That is reasonable .
Did the building rules complicate their plans ?
Guild : I have correctly handled my project under construction law .
The threat of Damocles &apos; sword of special construction and the &apos; &apos; stand-place &apos; regulations always makes it particularly difficult .
Absolutely .
It is still being suggested that those who create three apartments in a row house need at least three pitches .
Only in the cities does the place lack the space .
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
How did the local people react to their lineage project ?
Guiltans : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
What is definitely not true .
But do you not exacerbate competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : True , there is a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but luxury homes have been built which hardly can afford anything more .
My project has the message , and ordinary people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low earners .
I am showing how we can still build cheap and good buildings today .
That is what it is about .

iOS 9 : How to get the new iPad operating system when Apple Update is released .
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App , typing in &quot; General &quot; and then selecting &quot; Software Update &quot; .
If you are ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
Some people encountered problems after the installation , because they get an error message that says that the &quot; software update failed &quot; .
To avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the crash is down or try to update via iTunes .
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
This may mean deleting applets to create space - but Apple has made this less likely by streamlining the update , and it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete applets and reinstall them once the process is complete .
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is recharged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so the battery is charged .
If the charge is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the telephone may be shut down halfway and could lead to a breakdown in the update .

Rosberg ’ s only motto : Full Attack
Nico Rosberg is familiar with the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clear , well-established Mercedes-Team Lewis Hamilton .
The World Cup second stressed before the start of the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; I have nothing to lose &quot; .
53 points separate the vice-champion before the night in Singapore by title defenders and two-tier Hamilton .
The British won seven of the twelve seasons of the season and is also taking the Flutlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year the 30 year-old British race won the race .
Whether the current slump in the city state will influence Singapore &apos;s Great Price is still unclear .
For days , a dark bell hangs over the city , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra .
Bad Kissinger &apos;s Parliament has a prominent member
The losing club &quot; losing freunde Bad Kissingen &quot; , founded three months ago , has added another member to his ranks , so the number of players increased to 19 players .
The new member is Paul Gauselmann , a passionate tennis player and tennis player who has been in Bad Kissingen for more than 40 times .
Gauselmann is the official Swiss Federal Cross Cross Cross and honorary citizen of the towns of Espelkamp and Lübbecke .
Gauselmann has supported the club club in Bad Kissingen with a donation , which was attended by Alfred Klein .
This makes it possible to include non-member players who are unable to make the membership contribution .
Youth work and talent research are also to be promoted .
Gauselmann wants membership of the club club and also friendly contact with the Rot-Weiß Tennis Club to be seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town .
Quartiersbüro is looking for direct contact .
Saludis and Antonistift , the Altenzentrum , have joined forces under the Social Foundation and have opened a new point of contact at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz .
In addition to the consultation , there are also courses .
The social foundation draws it from the mountain into the city centre .
More specifically , the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz .
A new Quartiersoffice has recently been opened there .
Right next to the shopping market , here , the elderly and the consultant are now receiving information on issues such as care insurance or health care and care insurance .
For years , our outpatient care service has been making it clear that often care is left to those who are on their own .
There are endless questions about this .
&quot; Not very often , too , many of the benefits of the funds are not used , because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood , &quot; the new director Jutta Weigand explained , which is also responsible for the Antonist and the Civil Service and for the Achilles &apos; Hospital , which is the public health service .
In addition to the consultations , the new Quartiersoffice also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
The Saludis was taken on board for this purpose .
Therefore , additional offers such as overthrowing prevention , memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used .
The offers of the Seniors Centre and the Saludis complement each other perfectly .
Saludis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; The Centre for Care and Care &quot; , Heike Riedel , managing director of Saludis .
The new Quartig Office in the city centre is the reason for both business leaders in demographic change .
This is because it makes it essential to have good decentralised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future .
In addition , the Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) underlined the ceremonies , the Quartiersbüro also dedicates himself to the reconciliation of old age : &quot; There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular get-together . &quot;
The social foundation is thus a major contribution to enabling senior citizens to live as independently and as well as they can in their familiar environment .
The Quartiersoffice is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Vienna architect Karl Mang passed away from the age of 91 .
Karl Mang , one of the Vienna &apos;s doyen &apos;s doyen &apos;s , is dead .
He passed away on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house told on Tuesday .
Mang is a member of the Künstlerhaus , a member of the institution of honour and , at the same time , &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; , as it was in the programme .
Born in Vienna in 1922 , Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War .
Since 1952 he has been working as an architect , but also as a teacher , writer and director .
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Formation .
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treasury in the Vienna Imperial Palace and to transform the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian theatre museum .
Prison : Tim Wiese charges policeman with money
The former footballer Tim Wiese has fallen unnoticed in Bremen .
Footballers once were , now Tim Wiese , ex-National Director of the Tornado in Germany and Bremen and Hoffenheim are engaged , Wrestler .
He says that 30 kilograms of muscle mass have been used over the past two years .
On the other hand , he has not done intellectually .
The hair was scarce in the city centre , when he saw a parking space guard outside a prison outlet for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside .
Wiese then went out of business , insulted the official and threw her money into the pockets of her , as the picture of the picture reported .
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations , but it is still unclear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; The matter is still under examination &quot; , it is called by the City of Bremen .
Only after that will it be decided whether the meadow is displayed or not .

Men beat a 17-year-old Afghan
Witnesses are looking for police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster : on Friday evening , at around 23.45 , three young men were walking from Bad Soden to Salmünster .
One of the group &apos;s , a 17-year-old Afghan , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called upon them to wait for him .
At that time , the group was at the level of the petrol station .
Three people were also present at the station of the petrol station .
One of these men now screamed at the young people and beat him in the face of the face .
The victim suffered a rhinitis and blew out of the nose .
When his two friends struck and appealed to the thugs , he initially left his victim .
His friends brought the injured young man home .
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car , to the apartment , and then passed away on several occasions .
When the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured party went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
He was attacked again by the thugs and another male person .
The victim was attacked by a headscarf , and the victim &apos;s face and upper legs were examined .
The injured person had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
So far , there is only a vague description of the perpetrators .
One of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
The second racquet was supposed to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown white shirt .
The police are asking witnesses and referees to report on telephone number 06181 / 100-123 .
Dr Frank Müller is a Felstamausen and invests EUR 310,000 in real estate law .
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen .
This is also appreciated by the members of the association , Bernd Bormann , economic development fund for Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert .
In many places in the country , doctors are absent - Asendorf is lucky : Dr Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on 1 October .
While Ursel retires from Felstehausen , her husband , Karl-Heinrich , will be standing by his successor in the next few months with half a spot .
After a reconstruction phase , Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October , until then it will invest EUR 310,000 in the premises at Stlosses Marcellusstraße 6 .
It was a sympathetic moment when the rock outlines met Frank Müller and Dr Silvia Müller-Gongoll , who is currently completing her specialist training in the Verdener hospital and wants to see her put into practice next year .
&quot; We have always had the benefit of the garbage bin , &quot; says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs .
&quot; When it was done , I simply called it &quot; .
The idea of practising our own practice in Asendorf in future was given to Ehepaar Müller .
&quot; The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us &quot; , says 39-year-old Müller .
&quot; We want to meet and accompany families over the years &quot; .
He also sees his own boss as an asset .
And so people agreed that the garbage bin bought the house with practice .
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen .
He also raised the dual family father Frank Müller , who followed his medical studies in Hanover in several doctors &apos; offices and hospitals in Sulingen , Nienburg and Rotenburg .
He is currently a director of the Oberarzt in Sulingen and he was appointed the leading notary in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and is a volunteer member of the DRK &apos;s willingness to take over
From 19 September , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
While the surgeon Dr Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a doctor , his wife Ursel ( Internistin ) specializes in gastroenterology .
The garbage , both internalists , want to settle down as a housewife .
&quot; Endoscopy is therefore out of the question &quot; , says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll .
After the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ultrasound and long term and stress ECGs and need a voice room .
In addition , the EDV is completely renewed .
A total of EUR 50,000 will be granted to the garbage sector through a support programme of EUR 25,000 and the Samtgemeinde ( 12500 Euro ) and the municipality ( EUR 12500 ) .
&quot; This shows how proud and pleased we are that practice continues , &quot; stresses Samtner Mayor Bernd Bormann .
About 2000 patients are in the field of felsten pig , according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll , and in the average German average , it is around 500 .
There is another practice in Asendorf .
A positive side effect of the practice of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in Asendorf , according to Ursel Felstehausen .
If no successor had found himself , it would have gone .
By the way , anyone who visits Müllers &apos; speaking time will continue to look in familiar faces : the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force from the fields of the rock .
With their departure , an era ends in Asendorf , after all , doctors have been practising there for 30 years .
&quot; At the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ursel reminds Felstehausen of the land .
It is a little bit of anger that they feel after the long time .
&quot; But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients still often , &quot; said the Internitor .
Your husband adds to the fact that &quot; we have a 6000-square-foot plot . &quot;
&quot; I have always been concerned about gardening , but now it could be different &quot; .
In addition , the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; We let the refugees be by &quot;
&quot; Now border controls are also being pushed up at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner .
The controls at the Hungarian border remain at the same time .
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so .
The provision of care and security for human beings is a priority .
But it is also clear that it needs clear signals , as the Minister said .
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows , including the Austrian-Slovene border .
It needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia is not
The Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia , too , would like to leave the country moving towards Austria and Germany and could also establish corridors for refugees .
This was not the case , however , with the interior minister , Vesna Györkös Znidar , in Laibach .
The idea of corridors is &apos; totally unacceptable &apos; , but Slovenia will intensify the surveillance of the border , especially Hungary .
The border with Croatia , however , is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
As the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to lock its borders on refugees .
&quot; Every Member State must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; , said Györkös Znidar .
As the Croatian Government has informed us , the first refugees had already tried to travel to East Croatia at the Tovarnik / Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration .
Croatian police were able to take them up in nearby corn fields .
According to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been meeting since then in Tovarnik , Croatia .
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
The Red Cross is also in operation .
In the coming days , his country will be counting around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic .
Furthermore , buses from Presevo on the Macedonian / Serbian border , which hitherto had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be redirected towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
The Belgrade government , however , denied that it was to instruct people to go down certain routes : &quot; We cannot do it or we want to do it , &quot; it said .
According to the media reports , at least one bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early morning , and more buses would be expected during the day .
Via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been travelling all night long from the Macedonian border of Serbia , which is about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; We have heard that Hungary has made a pledge , so the police have told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
This could well lead to a somewhat further westward shift in the direction of the previous Balkan route between Turkey and Macedonia , which has already been predicted by observers .
Croatia : &quot; Comprehensive border control capabilities &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister , Ostojic , had previously stressed that , if refugees were to flood with a strong influx of refugees , they had prepared plans for possible emergency situations .
He did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non-Schengen member , has &quot; comprehensive border control capabilities &quot; .
We are implementing strict controls to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 , and since then the EU partners have consistently demonstrated the country &apos;s record of the standard of border controls .
On the Serbian side , some 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the night at the Horgo border crossing , which leads to Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings of Horgos and Brittany remain completely closed .
Whether the remaining refugees are now seeking to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
The Serbian Minister for Home Affairs , Nebojsa Stefanovic , tried to reassure on Wednesday at a local airport show in Horgo : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed to premature .
At present , it would not be very high refugee numbers .
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees , which contain alternative routes through Croatia .
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not without danger : some areas of the border area still have not cleared mines for some 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
On Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine-clearing agents had been sent to the border region .
Stock Exchange hackers : Ukrainians pay $ 30 million
Supranonok has been said to have been a cyber-crime ring accused of having repeatedly and repeatedly exchanged financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010 .
The information sought is intended to have insider dealing in financial markets .
In this way , the total amount of money spent on the investigation was more than $ 100 million .
&quot; Today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught &quot; , says the SEC communication .
The trial of 32 other accused persons in the case took place .
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
The perpetrators should have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe .
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in operation for 20 years .
There is a lively running area around the Mannheim Parade .
People are doing their worries , sometimes fast , sometimes in a cosy way .
You control the two stations of the Mannheim car salons at the Parade .
City railways are kept .
Pulsating , full life with a wonderful autumn sun and in the middle of four big plates with the headline &quot; Before I die I want to die &quot; ....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20 years of existence with this action and is certainly facing mixed reactions .
&quot; It is life , so we went to the city and to the people with the action , &quot; says Josefine Lammer .
The Ecumenical Hospice Assistance Board is available to the passers-by for questions and discussions , as well as for volunteers .
While some passers-by spontaneously take up the knuckle and the phrase &quot; affirm my life &quot; , &quot; can read &quot; , &quot; with the camper through the US , &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer &quot; , others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
There is a constant tendency for small discussions about action , about life and about how to kill them .
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot .
&quot; Only when I make it clear that I will eventually end up in this world , can I live responsibly , &quot; says the director of the Diaconic Works Mannheim , which is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid together with the Caritas
This is why this public action campaign for the 20 year-old is a good one .
It is understandable that not everyone wants to make public statements publicly , but it is a very personal matter .
The issue of death and dying remains taboo , as Josefine Lammer has had , although the hospitality movement has contributed much to opening people up in recent years .
An assessment that shares Angelika Godefroid .
The mortal and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
Having experienced the subject personally , they read a lot of literature and decided to commit themselves to euthanasia .
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid was called by the call for honour officials , it immediately contacted me and was present at the time of its foundation in 1995 .
Godefroid is a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who accompany affected persons and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hospital of Saint Vincent .
They are all carefully trained .
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and experience and experience .
&quot; I see life from another , consider it precious and appreciate the moment &quot; she says .
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenical Hospice service is free of charge and is independent of the association .
The financial support for health insurance funds and donations from families and associations allows for training and training and supervisions of the dying and migrant carers .
Training for new employees is offered every two years .
The plates described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
There , too , other personal wishes can be registered on postcards .
FedEx Result Comparative , Financial Perspective for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter and the supplier giant dropped its profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its boat-transport service .
The company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
At that time last year , FedEx announced that it would like to recruit 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
The share fell 45 minutes before the opening of Wednesday 45 minutes in pre-trade .
FedEx Corp. said that it would be worth a gain of $ 10.40 to $ 10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May , 20 cents less than the previous forecast .
Analysts expected $ 10.84 in a FactSet survey .
The outlook is lower , despite the increase in prices , which is 4.9 % on average and effective on 4 January , and despite higher surcharges for boat-carrying of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November onwards .
The company said that it expects the result to increase compared to last year , owing to cost reductions , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &apos; produces sound returns if it takes into account the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade &apos; .
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than the Rival UPS , which plans to employ 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year .
In the quarter ending on 31 August , FedEx earned 692 million , 6 % more than the previous year .
Earnings per share amounted to $ 2.42 per share , just under the $ 2.44 per share , which was predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research .
Sales rose by 5 % to $ 12.3 billion .
Six of Zacks surveyed predicted $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipments in recent years , which has brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagnation .
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground .
In the last quarter , the turnover in boat-transport increased by 29 % , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance .
Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in freight .
In pre-market trading , about one hour before the opening , FedEx stocks fell by $ 3.85 , or 2.5 % , to $ 150.15 .
On Tuesday , they closed 11 % for the year and 17 % below a record high on 11 June .
Two days later this week , at their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strategists sit around a 27-foot Honduran Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time in almost a decade .
A dreadful side of the wall at an end of the decorated two-storey meeting room is a wall of the United States .
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L . Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests before any other matter .
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maximising US employment and prices here is stable .
But , since the Great Recession , the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict , and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be discouraged from the unprecedented incentive of the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008 .
Although most of the data in the economy show that it is growing robustly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could frighten the already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by raising the federal bond rate - even by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; Obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lindsey M . Piegza , Chief Economist at the firm Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co .
&quot; But I think that if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is sufficient justification for continuing to wait , &quot; she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do , which is itself uncertain in itself to the financial market .
About half of the economists recently consulted by Bloomberg predicted that this week would raise interest rates .
The financial markets , however , expect the Fed to wait , with a key indicator indicating only a 30 % chance of an increase .
This suggests a fall in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate , unless the strategists will alleviate the blow by promising that further increases are far from being achieved .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4 % to 16.599.85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy would sustain the sentence this week , John Lonski , chief economist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be surprising if the Fed were to raise the rates at that time , &quot; he said .
If she does , she would have to go a long way in explaining the financial markets so that they do not panic .
Other experts argued that raising interest rates would reassure the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty over when the Fed will act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed to be well on the way to raising the 0.25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery .
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that , despite the protests from Liberals that more economic progress would be needed , this year they are expecting an increase in the rate .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labour market was robust this year .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and close to the level the Fed views as full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And , although inflation has been steadily falling below the 2 % target for the Central Bank , the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
The economy &apos; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension in the labour market &apos; , said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But the financial markets around the world were together at the end of last month , after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones Industrial average was down by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would slow down global growth .
The market has recovered somewhat this month , with the Dow now almost 10 % below the May high .
For the Fed , market turbulence is having a profound impact on the complexity of the calculation of when interest rates should be raised .
&quot; If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would be the ones to take hold of this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US Federal Reserve .
Now he predicts that he will wait at least a month to get better grips with the effects .
&quot; There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said Oliner .
The health of the world economy is not one of the Fed &apos;s main concerns , so it should not be included in its decision-making process .
But the bottom line is that the Fed has become the world ’ s monetary authority .
The Central Bank has had a huge influence over recent years .
The mere mention of the then director , Ben S , in 2013 , that the Fed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , the Fed representatives can be expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zachary Karabell , head of the global strategy for asset management at Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA , said this month that &apos; the Fed has a history of overreaction on financial market movements which apparently are not linked to fundamentals of economic fundamentals &apos; .
Lacker , a right-justified member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocated a rate hike , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited impact on US growth &quot; , said Lacker .
One year on , the Fed representatives reversed these cuts .
The Fed was to put financial stability issues first only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market crash , as Adam S pointed out , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s Interest Settlement Committee .
The recent turmoil does not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of raising interest rates because the markets are getting sticked up , &quot; said Posen , President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should preside over time .
Do you need a great Thai market ?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown .
Yes , Chinatown
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc .
LAX-C is often referred to as a Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market , which also sells to the general public .
Yes , it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town .
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a surprising number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and crockery , furniture , religious jewellery and Christmas decorations .
There is even an auto-department if you need petrol oil .
The shop is huge and it takes more than an hour to walk through the corridors .
If the whole shopping area is hungry , there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express .
The goblet ( good and cheap ) in this store is near the coffers and has various take-away options .
What is there here : Do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LAX-C is likely to be .
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruit and much more .
The meat counter is extensive , as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fix the fish and , if you wish , they will also be prepared for you .
A good part of the store is the massive freezer department , where frozen curry leaves , bitter melons and gasses , whole ducks , fish , bovine blood and gall , pork , fish bins , regional sausages , commercially prepared food and more .

Where he finds himself : The store is located in a Los Angeles industrial area on the outskirts of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
Parking : LAX-C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
Even if the shop is well frequented , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Hoyerswerda : Small Life-Help for Refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days .
A warm welcome to you is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
There are a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city .
They include Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul .
She is still very happy to teach her 74 lungs .
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum councillor at Dillinger Straße .
It helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
Of course , the whole class is different from a school .
Brazil ’ s Papal Refugee Society , Rio Grande , promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding .
The Brazilian Papabid organisation SPRS is shocking to try to explain to women how important good nutrition is during the breastfeeding process , and does so by presenting pictures of babies eating from breasts painted with food from unhealthy food .
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
Due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories a day .
However , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
A recent study led by Robert Waterland , Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors .
Unfortunately , the child &apos;s unhealthy diet can have a negative effect on the immune system .
Exceptions to the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The Municipal Council of Bernried approved the proposal for a EUR 2.3 million investment in the sports hall .
And he made an exception .
The roof may be shacked for solar systems .
The planning for the long-awaited gymnasium at the Bernrieder Sportpark is progressing step by step : the draft work on the draft submitted was unanimously approved at the most recent municipal meeting without any major discussions .
Previously , the panel had , among other things , adopted a proposal for a &apos; exception &apos; or &apos; exemption &apos; from the valid plan for building a legal system .
The exception was to allow a special form of roof construction .
So a &quot; saddle roof with a non-mite first and roofing &quot; is to be built .
The planning is to use the roof area for solar installations : &quot; This will bring together a wonderful southern roof &quot; , said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting .
In turn , the &quot; liberation &quot; was about the incitement to roost , which , for energy reasons - unlike the building plan - is to be less than ten degrees .
The volume of the hall is thus considerably reduced .
A &apos; liberation &apos; was necessary because the plan for the construction of roofs does not allow for &apos; exceptions &apos; - although the Bernsyl municipal council generally tends to be more restrictive in the case of requests for exemptions .
Turnkey construction is not a recurring project : &quot; We are not creating a precedent &quot; , says Steigenberger .
The Turnhallenbau at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bernried .
Around EUR 2.3 million are charged at the expense .
Aid is expected to be provided by support for education and training .
In the next stage of the procedure , the application for the 18 x 36 metres hall will now be submitted to the Council of State for its consideration .
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital in Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
At the same time , Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is to be appointed Director of Medical Services at the hospital in Schongau .
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau .
This is evident from the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which was confirmed by Count Andrea Jochner-Weiß .
However , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
If the plans were to be implemented , all those under 50 employees would be employed at the Peißenberg hospital .
The vast majority should move with Fischer and the farther inland station to Schongau .
The rooms are available .
Employees who cannot come to Schongau are supposed to be offered a job in Weilheim , so Jochner-Weiß is .
The staff were informed about the plans .
The change has been replaced by the termination of Dr Andreas Eder , who has only been in office since the beginning of the year of medical director of the Schongauer Clinic and is now moving to a private practice in a more immediate
The name &quot; Fischer &quot; , which was agreed to take over from 1 October , was announced by Jochner-Weiß , who declared that he would take over from 1 October and change with his team to Schongau .
In any case , this would mean &quot; upgrading &quot; and broadening the offer in the area of &quot; internal medicine &quot; , according to Jochner-Weiß , for the House of Schongau .
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators .
Schongau ( 180 beds ) is specialised in gastroenterological diseases on the Inner Station .
The transitional period for the next two years is to lead fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , to run both houses , and then , next year , the former hospital of the shortage , which still has more than 35 beds , is to close down in Peißenberg after almost
Until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the rehabilitation at the hospital in Weilheim is now complete .
Councillor Jochner-Weiß , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , has been shocked to see that the House , which is in possession of the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the
&quot; I will end , &quot; and Jochner-Weiß could not say how things are going on with the real estate , there are several considerations .
At present , caritas and a daily psychiatry are housed there .
&quot; What could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back &quot; , fishermen have been told about the quasi-move to the void , which the staff had &quot; positively and very sympathetically &quot; included .
There has been no real prospect for the House , where fishermen have been working as chefs for over 30 years .
He was asked by Mr Schongauer to take over the post of the Medical Director .
The Peißenberg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been under threat of closure over the past few decades , departments have been closed down , for example surgery and birth care .
The handlebars of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are being called on at the mountain HC this evening ( 20.15 ) .
The Bundesliga &apos;s spreadsheet is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogance .
Last season , the bathers suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and they had to make a good start .
Hunting with two Dead Dead at Pratau
Two tractors were seriously injured during their Maismen on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
During the crusade on a maize field near Pratau ( Gertenberg county ) several hunters were in use , as the police have informed .
After a foot drop , a 63-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
The exact outcome of the accident was unclear .
The criminal police are identified .
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime .
A suspect has been leading the police to the corpse of the 16-year-old missing since Saturday from the Rhineland-Palatinate .
In interrogation , the 20-year-old admitted that they had killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a channel in Rockenhausen .
A 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday has been the victim of a violent crime .
The young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern , as public prosecutor &apos;s office and police shared on Wednesday .
A 20 year-old woman , also noted on Tuesday evening , is a real suspect , who has said that the investigation was carried out and that the investigators were investigating the site .
The 16-year-old was not reported on Sunday morning , after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit to a autumn festival in Rockenhausen .
When searching for the young woman , the investigators initially found out about the victim &apos;s personal objects .
After all , a suspicion was found in the friends and acquaintances of the missing persons , who were the subject of a suspicion against the 20-year-old .
The alleged perpetrator then led the police into a channel in Rockenhausen , where the body was found .
According to the arrest , the authorities were in police interrogation , killing the 16-year-old and putting the corpse into the channel .
The 20-year-old should be brought to the dock on Wednesday , the investigators are being charged with his death .
The next investigation will provide an insight into the circumstances of the case .
Refugees need shelter : study warns of housing gaps
The situation on the German housing market is tense .
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable accommodation .
The pressure on housing is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
The defence battle in the German housing market has been starting for a long time .
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many large cities .
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing .
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020 .
A study commissioned by the Alliance of Social Adults Councils will be presented on this basis .
By way of comparison , this year , 260,000 units will be completed in Germany .
That means that there are no more than 140,000 homes .
After the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first reception accommodation .
Many then go to the housing market and join in the long queues before the rental flats .
According to the Federal Statistical Office , less than half of all asylum seekers were able to stay on the roads last year .
The negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
The study also reveals considerable shortcomings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing year on year .
At present , there are already some 770,000 housing units missing in the conurbations , complaining Matthias Günther , author of the study .
Many people in the working world therefore lived in WG rooms in large cities .
Young adults have been unwillingly staying longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the housing market .
In the large cities , the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years .
To solve the problem , the Alliance of Social Housing proposes a restart .
New incentives are to stimulate social housing .
This would mean that the principle of mortgage income could be forfeited and that the land tax on subsidised housing would be suspended for a limited period .
In addition , the alliance requires attractive tax deferral opportunities .
The support programme for the refugee shelter of the State Bank of KfW is already good for cities and communities .
On Monday evening , with EUR 184 million , more than half of the EUR 300 million available had already been called up after the launch .
Now the project could even be increased .
Refugees have free passage : Croatia and Slovenia are directing corridor to a corridor .
After Hungary , there is practically no passage , as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces that it will be leaving the country without obstacles via Slovenia .
The route is nevertheless dangerous .
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor .
&quot; I spoke to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior and , if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister for Home Affairs Ranko Ostojic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
After the secession of the Serbian / Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been forced to enter Croatia to enter Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with Tovarnik , reports the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had suspended its border on refugees the day before .
New laws that came into force the same day make Hungary , moreover , practically superfluous with ordinary asylum procedures .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said : &quot; You can travel and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
These people are here , it is women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
However , they were not people who did not want to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border with Croatia &apos;s border with Croatia in the morning .
Most media reports have been published in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
They arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid , both by bus and by taxi .
Immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot via the green border .
On the Croatian / Serbian border , refugees are not on border fences .
The border strip has other dangers , and there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
Mine-clearance agencies are now to make a safe passage quickly .
After Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the border has closed .
On Tuesday , the police counted 366 people .
Just before the closing of the Tor show on Monday , 9380 were still in use .
The new Hungarian laws are a criminal offence against overcoming and damaging the border fence .
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged , therefore , 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated .
The sentenced to five years is threatened with imprisonment and deportation from the country .
According to the immigration agency , on Tuesday , 94 asylum applications were received in the new transit zones established at the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition .
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
On Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have been stopped there .
In practice , however , no one has any prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
According to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &apos; safe third country &apos; .
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
There were only a few hundred refugees before the &quot; transit one &quot; in Röszke .
Workers began to clean up in Röszke .
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people left on the streets in recent weeks .
Sperrgitter was dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt .
No one wanted to comment on the objective of this transformation .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
The country has also stepped up its border controls .
According to government figures , the 20,000 migrants remained in the country .
In Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for Germany to move on .
The train from there to Germany was stopped at the request of German authorities in the morning .
In the open air , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; rock &quot; across the border
&quot; We were busy after the Sunday celebrations , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says Wernstein &apos;s mayor Alois Stadler .
Tourists , they wanted to go to Passau by train .
Because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , due to the flow of refugees , it was in Wernstein , however , &quot; says Stadler , who immediately offered his help and who , together with two other helpers and their cars , took over the border into the Nahe Passau .
Before that , we first treated the unhoped-for guests with a little more of a drink and a drink .
We said just now that we bring them by car to Passau .
&quot; That was obvious to us &quot; , as Stadler said in the OON discussion .
They were very grateful .
A man did not take it to hand in a generous donation - EUR 100 for the fire brigade .
&quot; That was a great pleasure to us &quot; , says Stadler .
The busy train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in Passau on Sunday evening , and after the announcement in the short term that rail traffic was being stopped in Germany , it still had to be tried .
The regional train was shut off in front of the Wernstein river border on the Inn .
In Wernstein , the boundary crossing is generally high in the course of the course .
The Brückenfest with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was blessed , a two-stroke race was organised in sport - organised by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen .
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending us another tens of thousands is a logical result of hypocritical politics :
Instead of helping to establish structures in the Röszke camp immediately , our Chancellor has made the Hungarian Government &apos;s attitude to the vanguard of Nazism , both officially and publicly , in a highly formal and public manner .
This policy is not only the result of those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border regions .
The poultry will also have to find that the &quot; promised land &quot; that she invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for those seeking protection .
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35.000 winter-resistant quarrels
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugee shelter .
Christian Konrad is used to his word .
The government has used the former mighty Raiffeisen banker to create quarters for the thousands of refugees .
The chaos in the Traiskirchen first-line reception centre has already brought Konrad into control .
&quot; We no longer have homeless in Traiskirchen , &quot; he told his first success .
The fact that the 20,000 refugees who arrived on Monday in Austria had been given no great deal of impetus was also carried out , as Konrad said , and praised the organisational &quot; master-performance &quot; .
The Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis situation &quot; .
Overall , Konrad expects 85,000 quartz to be quartered in this year .
In order to meet the figure , there will have to be 35 000 more in the next few weeks - 20,000 will be allocated to the countries , 15,000 of them will be .
If there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; But it is not a bottomless pit , &quot; Konrad said .
He has already held talks with the heads of state .
They would have promised him that they would create a quartier for the refugees who are coming .
&quot; It is going well in Upper Austria &quot; , said Ferry Maier .
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad .
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , to clarify how the Church will help .
The asylum coordinator also has great expectations in the ORF action &quot; Help us &quot; .
On the platform , private individuals can offer accommodation in a simple way .
In addition , you are hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter .
Yesterday , Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high &quot; .
In times of emergency , it is not possible for the managers to have to comply with a certain amount of toothbrush or the size of the upper limit .
For a limited period of time , &apos; emergency standards &apos; would have to apply .
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , is more successful in providing accommodation , justifies Konrad ’ s experience .
I am an older gentleman who is not quite sure to tell the truth .
The power of persuasion is its main weapon .
Conrad and maize do not cost the Republic any costs , as they themselves declared .
Their staff want to increase them to three to four .
The search for a quartier has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a booth at Stephansplatz as an office .
But there are apparently problems with authorisation .
Linz calls for a better division
Linz is not planning to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and the Design Center for the accommodation of refugees .
This is not necessary at the moment , because the people affected can be accommodated at the moment without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) .
However , other sites are to be tested for their suitability for emergencies .
Critics are criticized by the head of the town for the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
Other districts must also play their part here .
Seal of the sea : &quot; Borders are not cut off &quot;
In a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer ( CSU ) , the head of state , Josef Pühringer ( VP ) , has taken a more serious approach to the issue of refugee status on Monday .
Seehofer assured me that the German borders are not being dismantled .
The transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
However , the border controls are now in place .
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not exist for the time being .
The protection seekers would , however , be transported to Germany with regular trains .
Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU Member States .
The fact that Austria is now introducing controls at its borders is a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans for Pühringer .
The Next Runtastic is a Time of Time
The General Reformation of the &quot; Neue Werft &quot; in the Linzer industrial line is officially closed .
In four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is being moved into the market , the remainder ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative technology companies .
&quot; In IT , the intelligent heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for ourselves &quot; , says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Niederhauser .
He could imagine investing in start-up companies in the New Advertising Company and subsequently acquiring what they could do .
From the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something which Niederhauser promises to do : &quot; The next runtast is only a matter of time &quot; .
EUR 1.7 million was invested in the site by S &amp; T , EUR 3.3 million from the techcenter , which is one third of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government of Upper Austria and the Federal Government of Bavaria (
The building is reserved for 60 years by Linz AG to S &amp; T and Techcenter .
30 per cent of the 2700 square metres of the building is already rented , and there are requests for a further 40 % .
Lia-Peroni holder opened second business in the Arkade
The new shop focuses on the Fura Handbags .
Jutta Breit was actually trying to make a dog .
This project had to postpone the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt Arkade : after all , she has now gained growth in the form of another business location .
In the Furla-Shop against the shop , where it sells bags , suitcases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revolves around the Furla handbags , purses are from 75 euros .
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
The new shop is now in operation .
Previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; I have thought about whether I should open a shop for a long time , &quot; says Breit .
One of the reasons for the decision was that the Furlapians who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location , where only their handbags are sold .
&quot; We are the only ones in the greater area of Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who have Italian roots .
Breit has been put into her mother &apos;s modesty by her mother &apos;s interest .
I find it most helpful when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
Why some women are wasting their time looking at a beautiful handbag , even the specialist cannot answer with the last word of certainty .
Maybe it is because a nice bag is upgrading every outfit .
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump &apos;s torchlight ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called by the people .
This is a feature that many people , including the billionaire , want to become .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for excuses .
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic , deals with journalists , or reveals gaps in international crisis politics , the candidate for the US presidency is vigorously throwing up the campaign .
And it is doing well .
This is also recorded in the Painting City of Kallstadt , where the grandparents of the real estate billiard originate .
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a concept in the winemakers village on the Wine Road .
Some in the 1200-resident site is over -40 corners related to him .
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate : Donald Trump , here in the election campaign mode .
The son-in-town Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump .
And what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the world &apos;s most powerful man ?
&quot; I think they find this somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style , &quot; says Simone Wendel .
The native city of Kallstadt has shot an amusing documentary about the place and its famous exploits , including the Heinz Ketchup family , besides Trump .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , also speaks in Kings of Kallstadt ( 2014 ) , saying that he would certainly succeed if he lived in Kallstadt .
He did not bring it to the king &apos;s king .
While there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the tendency to believe that Trump is a bit of a great moth , Wendel says .
It happened that the nickname that Kallstadt had in the circle , &quot; Die Brulljesmacher &quot; - to &quot; Hochdeutsch &quot; ( the employees , she says ) .
Trump comes from the village of the workers .
The Trump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the late grandfather emigrated and opened a gold mine in the United States .
The property was the first property of real estate in New York .
But the life of grandparents was not free of tragedy : your desire to return to your home in the long term failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Palatinate belonged .
He did not take Trump because he was once abandoned without authorisation , the director of the Institute of Prussian History and Folk Student , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
Trump is the grandson of an &quot; illegal emigration &quot; .
This contrasts with what is sometimes evident in the case of descendants .
It has repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; Just as the pollination is not so agreeable , &quot; Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant relative Trump ( &quot; The Oma was a born Trump , the opa was born Heinz &quot; ) says .
The farmer in retirement sees the Americans rather as &quot; he is always so awkward &quot; .
Does he think that Trump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that &quot; , says the 72-year-old .
&quot; He never looked after Kallstadt .
The lawyer Veronika Schramm , like many Kallstadter , mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family would , on a visit , donate something to the church organ , which was generally well received .
&quot; I cannot imagine that from the Donald &quot; , says the 68-year-old .
They would do better if he did not raise the election , because &apos; he has such radical views , I do not know if that is good &apos; .
If those who had been in the lead in the United States at the time of his grandfather were to have been like him , &quot; he would never have ever arrived &quot; .
&quot; There are more interesting issues than he says , &quot; says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler .
And as President ?
&quot; My President is not , &quot; she says .
And &apos; the grapes are ripe without President Trump &apos; .
Wendel &apos;s film , for which Trump has long been interviewed , has seen 12 000 cinematographers , including in the United States , who are interested in the interest .
The Upper Bavarian village of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany &apos;s first mountain climber village .
The 1800-inhabitants village of the Berchtesgaden National Park was awarded the award for soft tourism on Wednesday from the Vice-Chairman of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wucherpfennig .
In Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbers &quot; .
In the neighbouring country , the Alpine Association for the award of the award is responsible for awarding the award .
A mountain climber village may not have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
Seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the assessments , despite Nine &apos;s attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show .
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rushed to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberal leadership , but it has not made much of a shift in the assessments for Today .
The Nine breakfast show was broadcast by the Federal Capital , when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott .
The Rivale Sunrise , with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls , and Cancun .
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers at the five main cities , compared with Today 339.000 .
Today , a slight increase was achieved in comparison with ratings for Monday ( 317,000 ) and Tuesday ( 283,000 ) , but its number fell short of last Thursday ( 343.000 ) .
Today , the Sunrise gap has been closed in recent months .
In August , the average day of the show reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 from Sunrise .
At the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far , Sunrise has reached 314,000 in September at an average of 349.000 viewers .
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
The winds of change affect these mornants more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are in order , thank you for the review !

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson .
The new drama about a recently wielded father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand has reached a very impressive figure of 1.219 million viewers .
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show Solo without the Rafter Star Rebecca Gibney .
The result of last night answered that with a clear &apos; yes &apos; .
The X-Factor from Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 838.000 ) and TBL Families ( 726.000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
The first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.30 ) of the new quince show , moderated by Andrew O &apos;Keefe , averaged 446,000 spectators .
The second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat ( 613,000 ) .
On Monday evening , the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half of the hour , 720,000 .
The average hotel is 620,000 .
The fall in the second round of The Chase Australia ’ s quotas will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
The Chase Australia is a $ 1 million substitute for the McGuires show .

The last three are in agreement : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
The secret reveals ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows , Sarah Mackay , and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly clearly shown who wins The Bachelor .
The woman who eventually landed in The Bachelor where Sam Wood finally landed was wounded in the greatest secrecy .
And none of the three left girls will not reveal whether it is the one who received the last rose .
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay , Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three of them became out of three , you may have accidentally given a hint of who the winner will be .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly on Thursday until the final finals .
All three women have been lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man , calling his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitudes as the reason why they would like to be his partner .
However , if the question is asked , &quot; if you don &apos;t you , who should get Woods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; , your answers could become the spoiler of the players who won the burial heart .
Jeavont Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay , other than themselves , as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; From the moment I went to the house ( Sarahs ) and Sam &apos;s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Jeavons-Fellows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground , so much fun to be with her , &quot; Markoski added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
From her point of view , Mackay said that last week &apos;s house visit made her realize that Wood could be &quot; the One &quot; .
&quot; As soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly suspended &quot; , she said .
And when asked whom Wood should choose , if not , it was puzzling .
&quot; I do not know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between Snezana and Lana .
The Bachelor will be broadcasted on 10 on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
Originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49s and coach Jim Tomsula , and it looks like a wise decision .
Some trainees had banned Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a wrangling as the Aussie-Rugby-Line conversion did on his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota .
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next chance to return to point and also to the ongoing game after a breach of Reggie Bush .
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
Instead of calling his Rookies to the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne at his press conference after the match .
The 49th sports reporter , Cam Inman , reported that Hayne was also encouraged by the special teammate Thomas McGaughey , who advised him to forget his patched catch and to look after the next game .
Jarryd Hayne is a punt born in the first game area of Minnesota Vikings .
It was certainly not the start of Hayne and his massive Australian followship for his NFL debuture .
Hayne left the field in flux after the Fumble and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish &amp; Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career , but that he would not be able to
&quot; That was a thing that happens now , you only look after the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hayne said .
Hayne compared the cutter with his Origin debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in-Goal area led to a jet for Queensland .
Overall , however , it was a great experience for the 27-year-old .
Hayne put together a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the match and insisted on his instagram .

Free voters are demanding the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees .
At the start of the FW Cam in Grosswallstadt , party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were not new teachers for the many new pupils : &quot; We need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect schools from collapse , &quot; said Aiwanger .
&quot; Otherwise , we will get disappointments in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
The polling stations are held in the subterranean community until Friday .
In fact , quite different main themes were provided for .
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Electoral Meeting .
&quot; Of course , asylum will overload the issue of asylum , &quot; said Aiwanger .
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protections for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s .
&quot; This is no longer possible , we must face the causes , &quot; said the Liberal Democrat chief .
Reduced asylum seekers want to get rid of the outsiders as soon as possible .
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum applications : &quot; We need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Aiwanger .
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; We need uniform standards in the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is moving away , others are not . &quot;
&quot; We need to be more able to act in this regard . &quot;
But the country &apos;s regional policy is not to be sidelined in the city of Großwallstadt .
A long-standing burning burner remains on the agenda : education policy .
On the new school year , the Minister for Education , Ludwig Spaenle ( CSU ) , has launched the pilot experiment &quot; Mittelstufe plus &quot; ( Category 1 ) in 47 Gymnasiums , which is testing an extension of the three-year intermediate intermediate stage from three to four years - the result will
But this is not going far enough for Aiwanger .
&quot; The subject of G9 has to be speeded up , &quot; said the FW chief .
We demand freedom of choice for all Gymnasians who want this .
Free ride to G9 wherever desired .

4 people killed after policemen shot rubber bullets on demonstrators in Nepal .
Four people , including a 4-year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police shot blanket bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said one official on Wednesday .
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , Chief of District Officers , said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before taking back on rubber racks .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets that are known to kill but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative seem to have produced such a high death rate .
The controversy was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
There have also been protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflict since the 10 .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , killed an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled over centuries .
Work on a new constitution has been on track since 2008 , but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
The legislators voted on certain clauses in Kathmandu this week , and officials have said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
Construction Area in the City
The property at the Alte Post youth centre is to be restored .
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square metre area .
There is a mixture of trade , commerce and housing - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a property of about 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Alte Post youth centre .
Preparations are under way .
The intention is to use the site for a mixture of commerce , commerce and housing .
The city is waiting for the corresponding offers , that is to say , from the city .
Which investor is questioning is not yet clear .
Accordingly , no treaties have been concluded .
The city of Emden had bought part of the land on the Ringstrasse / Corner Road , a few months ago , and demolished the building on it .
Hieve Project : Details are on the table .
Plantations on the settlement of the cottage on the small sea at Emden are taking shape .
The investor presented for the first time public plans for the project .
Some of the residents are still concerned - they fear that their leisure activities will be sold out .
For months , negotiations were negotiated , grated , debated and drawn behind closed doors .
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea are on the table .
The Intermediate Emder Company &quot; System-Bau &quot; , the medium-sized emler company &quot; System-Bau &quot; , presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the Empress Council .
Originally , this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda .
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP group , who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy , Ralf Behrends of the System-Building Executive went on the offensive : &quot; We have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
But it is good to be able to face all the rumours now .
The project , which has been expensive for about ten to twelve million euros , has been under discussion for months .
The response of the sea owners to the meetings was intense , and the pictures and new details of the hotel were being produced .
Roberto Schulz , a seaport owner and member of the board of directors of the stakeholders , Pro Hieve , is complaining that &quot; this will be a huge blast that will surprise all other subjects &quot; .
Moreover , like many other project critics , he fears that the planned size of the plant would increase traffic considerably : &quot; There are whole bus charges to be expected to be calculated , &quot; he said .
What is happening on the well-kept area of the former restaurant is still open .
There is no operator yet .
&quot; We must have a coherent approach first , &quot; Ralf Behrends said .
Because it was still lacking , the plans for the construction of the building were also variable .
Ztwin young people at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to have a new life in its gorillas .
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday .
Twin beds are rare in Gorillas .
The last one in a German zoo is nearly 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967 , it is called by the zoo .
The sex of newborn gorilla twins is not yet certain , as Mother Dian has so far kept her close to the body .
First , the picture was reported .
NHC predicts 60 % chance of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands .
The US National Hurricane Center predicted a broad low-pressure system on Tuesday , around 350 miles ( 560 km ) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands , which has a 60 % chance of becoming a tropical hurricane over the next 48 hours .
Another clearly defined low pressure system , for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles , has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical hurricane over the next two days , adding the meteorological experts stationed in Miami .
Google launches double fundraising campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( GOOGL O ) announced a doubling fundraising campaign to raise EUR 11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have been overrun by the European nations , fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the fundraising request on its blog .
Instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Masoud , a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; We were in a lot of dark train and bus journeys , hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
But as the refugee and migration crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperately looking for help .
Donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : Médecins sans Frontières , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said that the first global donations up to $ 11 million were doubled to $ 5.5 million on google.com / compliance .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
Many also flee from the war wrecked by war , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya .

Weighing loss surgery can be helpful for diabetics who are overweight .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
It is too early to say whether patients with diabetes are living longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
&quot; The mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr Robin Blackstone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a key article on the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Weight loss operations or astigmatism surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the ability to eat food .
Over the years , Adiposital operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved to be effective , but most studies have been carried out in people who are ill with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected since 2007 in a study , comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach embryo - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 in the course of the fifth year in this study .
Meanwhile , the BMI has remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
Among those who undergo surgery , 36 % of the disease was caused by diabetes altogether and 28 % in part .
In the medical treatment group , diabetes was only a total of one percent and in some cases only about 2 % .
Moreover , the results of the checks on blood pressure , triglycerides and &quot; bad &quot; LDL cholesterol in general were better in the surgical group , the authors found out .
The researchers also supervised the Hämoglobin A1c Patient Bulletin , which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 % , and researchers write .
After the operation , the average haematograph in A1c fell from around 9 % to around 6 % .
However , the medical therapy group remained stable at around 8 % .
But this better &apos; glycemic control &apos; - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr Chirac Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the Bypass Surgeon Group lost more weight compared to the Gastrektomy Group ( 18.7 TFgs . 14.2 kg ) , reached larger drops in BMI ( 7.4 to 5.1 ) and hematoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % , 2.1 % ) and more marked a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.9 % , 16.7 %
While the new study does not provide a survival advantage for surgery after five years , there are indications from a study by a heavier Swedish population that surgery leads to a longer life , says Blackstone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
The Swedish study showed that about 29 % less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obese people undergoing an obesity-operation - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study did not benefit the survival of surgeon patients , Blackstone said that it was reassuring to those with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in the process .
&quot; This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; she said , without any risk of death or kidney disease .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight when the patient is between 27 and 30 with his BMI .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult . &apos;
Love History is in Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently being increasingly taken into account in the field of ventilation : a young woman , unpopular and unwise at school , meets her youth ’ s plow again after years , and she falls in love with her .
In the novel &quot; Actually , we are not like that &quot; by Luisa Binder .
Beyond the love story , the novel should be of particular interest to Hunsrück readers , because he plays in Langweiler and surrounding villages .
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she has been able to set a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is a real solution .
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugee countries .
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford , which deals with ethics studies .
He demanded that , in the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
He also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable but is not appropriate .
&quot; It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria for his efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; It is wonderful to look after thousands of refugees , but in the meantime , you will have to think about long-term solutions to how to create a true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
Ultimately , we must think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We must reduce the use of force .
&apos;The use of force has never solved these problems &apos; , he added .
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and found that the violent response of the US led to a chain of uncontrollable events .
After 11 September , I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is non-violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
Four hundred and four years of age in the use of hememulsizing agents by children over the last four years
The US poison control centres report an almost 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants , according to the Georgia Poison Center .
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez , Director of the Georgia Poison Center , the incidence of disposable infectious agents among children under 12 years of age reported to toxic control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014 .
&quot; Children are coming more and more often to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency &quot; , said Lopez CNN .
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some are doing so to impress their friends or to have a mutuation in the social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience .
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouth-water to obtain a tougher drink .
Young children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants .
&quot; A child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lopez .
Many of the more attractive ( hand disinfectants ) are those that are perfected .
There are disinfectants with strawberry , grape and orange scents , which are very appealing to children .
The use of adhesive agents contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
In the case of young children in particular , few people can already be infected with alcohol poisoning .
&quot; It is highly concentrated alcohol &quot; , Dr Stephen Thornton , medical director of the GiftnotrufCenter in Kansas University , Kane Fox 4 , in Kansa City .
So you would not let a slice of whisky be around , but people leave these hands-on disinfectants within reach of children and if children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who recently took four out of the shoes after strawberry contraceptives at school , was brought to an emergency reception .
Its blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk by an adult , Dr Chris Ritchey , an emergency doctor , who treated it in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
Nhaijah lallned her words and was unable to go when she arrived at the emergency reception .
Doctors supervised them overnight in a separate nursery house on signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through alcohol and had fallen head , said Ritchey .
&quot; That was very frightening , &quot; said Ortoria Scott , Nhaijahs Mother , CNN .
It could have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft non-alcoholic products or disinfectant towels and to store disinfectant products outside the scope of the child .
In addition to alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants were associated with deaths .
In 2013 , two women died in Ontario after the swallowing of contraceptives containing toxic , undeclared ingredients .
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol , a deadly solution , rather than ethyl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
In January , three fourth class students in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teachers by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to the use of contraceptive substances and she has banished them from her room .
The police regarded the foiled plan as &quot; scaffold &quot; and drew disciplinary measures to the school .
Villingen-Schwenningen : Three vehicles
In case of a crash on the cross section between the North Ring and Herders , a 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in a crash accident .
A 60 year lorry driver drove an industrial area on the cross track towards roundabout and assumed that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the roundabout .
He then competed with his truck in the rear of an audit and turned this vehicle into a Ford Fiesta .
The vehicles involved in accidents caused about EUR 10 000 , the police said .
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready for use and had to be taken off .
Rumour kitchen : No discord at Celtic
Griffiths is playing down the talk of discord at Celtic Glasgow , Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place , but that he will turn that back .
Hearts will fight SFA for accusations by Neilson , and Warburton will be careful with Yanukovych &apos;s new commitments that might destroy the Kader &apos;s unity .
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys ’ s first half-hour Elf gave Aberdeen a slice victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie , so the Dons create a five-point gap between the Celtic and Celtic .
Griffiths plays down talk of discord
There are rumours of the discord at Celtic Glasgow , something spontaneously rejected by Griffiths , who insisted that he and his team members should not be under greater control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch tableleader .
I do not believe that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
The lack of title competition in Scottish football borrows Dutch - de Boer
The former Ranger midfield player and former national player of the Netherlands , Ronald de Boer , said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , because there is no title-rivalry with the Rangers .
De Boer , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; In Holland , they no longer show any highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot;
It is because the Rangers are not there .
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers .
You are talking about the Old Firm .
They talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
There is a lot of tension in the old-fashioned games , and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Deila .
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss is swearing to turn things around .
After defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by a defeat of 10 men from Aberdeen , who now have five points at the top of the table .
Deila said , however , &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot;
Now we want to get out of it as quickly as possible .
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
We feel that is exactly the way we are - but we must go further .
We really need , really , Celtic support , because that makes players better .
It is so important to stand together now .
Warburton cautiously in January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago , which indicated that he had been rushing towards January , Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox Kader .
The ex-boss of Brentford said : &quot; The January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
The players who come in the summer have this pre-saison time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
The team is really good .
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic Target Person Michu with a referral note
Swansea Stürmer Michu , talking to Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract expires with the Swans .
The 29-year-old has been plagued by a foul apple for two years and has not managed to get away from Wales this summer .
Hearts on SFA battle for Neilson &apos;s comments
The Hearts carried 2 : 1 , when Paterson was sent by the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red card of the defender was later lifted - the third Red card of Collum , which was revoked in eight months .
Neilson remains with what he said and insists : &apos; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented on merit . &apos;
Griffiths swears to avoid tynecaths
The untidy hibee was defaulted after he admitted that he had sung a song with angry texts about ex-Hearts players Rudi Skacel .
The incident occurred in a roseburn plant in Edinburgh before Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014 .
&quot; It was a Derby , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; the stormer said , and added : &quot; It is safe to say that I am not going back to Tynecastle if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-Unit-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United &apos;s Board of Management has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but it is clear that the decline must end in the field .
I think that Stephen Thompson has confidence in us .
We will take the boys back on the road , &quot; said Donnelly .
McInnes is happy to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton .
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight with desperate fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive League victory , bringing him a lead of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys ’ s elven in the first half .
McInnes said : &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or leagues , which have not won games of this kind . &quot;
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while the United Kingdom as a whole is on the rise .
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged for the period May to July , with the loss of the UK as a whole , with the UK as a whole in the same period , rising by 10,000 to 1.82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.9 % was higher than that of the UK of 5.5 % , as shown by the figures of the National Statistical Office ( ONS ) .
Meanwhile , employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,612,000 .
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 % in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 % .
The Secretary of State for Scotland , David Mundell , commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; The government &apos;s long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
It is almost a year since Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
Over the past 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market , with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment .
The process of drying up the wall disturbed the process .
As security personnel could not satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
Only with the use of Pfefferspray could the officials take the trouble of the troublemakers .
A moderate alcohol test showed 0.89 Promille at a 16-year-old .

Why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma ?
A little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see a man being killed .
If it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will be sitting in a public gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is exterminated by poison injection .
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation was first received in January , on his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed .
When the day was approaching , I began to fear myself .
So why should I ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US , and , as often more applications are available than seats , a makeup lottery is taking place to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Anyone who is selected will be watching it without emotion .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossips ’ closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we speak .
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of abandoning my impartiality on Twitter .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes and you get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she could &quot; have been better formated &quot; , but she still thinks that it is wrong to do what I do .
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
He does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do so even if he were to do so .
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there .
If he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bellware , a Huffington Post reporter , will be sitting next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts I have made .
I do not want to go into all the details again .
I cannot say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a defender of the act .
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that it will not be guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn to .
What you will get from me is what it means to see an unnecessary death for a man .
He is persuaded to come from the canning river after a wet police hunt .
The Canning Vale Polizist remained dry when he persuaded the man of the Canning River .
An attempt by a man of Perth to punish the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swingy water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persuade him to return to the shore . &quot;
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday to make a Hausfriedensh-on-the-go incident in Beckenham .
When they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the Canning River .
But it did not come far too far .
&quot; He stood in the water and said &apos; I do not come out , come and drink , said senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine .
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tactic - &quot; A good policeman .
&quot; Sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said senior Sergeant Castledine .
Master football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example .
In 2006 , Cousins drove his car to the grave to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
His efforts have been unsuccessful but inspired by the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon .
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing sport .
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria Stewards has tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
He focused on the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai &apos;s Late Scratching for a racing performance on Wednesday , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive Kobalt shooter test at Lidaris , which he cannot explain .
He had been held for 18 months because of spying and did not want to see it &quot; look like a heavy hanging grape . &quot;
&quot; I had not said anything about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moody .
You know that things went on .
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go over my head and I want my owners to think that I am doing my best for them .
If they start thinking , I do not , then I should not be more trainer .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
Before that , Moody had launched the bomb in an interview with racing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do inside my stables , &quot; Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to believe that I am a scam .
If that is the case , surely they should be at their nest because they have failed in trying to take me .
Robert Roulston , former chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , current President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of the RVL , was aware of this at the time and is still today .
Should that be my personal opinion ?
Has the RVL been cowardly and is it perhaps the case that people outside the trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Maybe people out there think that I am .
Perhaps they must take my license and break me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying will give them pause for thought .
But I have now reached the point where I do not care , and that makes me sad .
I am really sad .
I will put pressure on them and urge them to take a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The training levels of the coach have been built up with the long cocoa test at Lidari , and the Late Scratching has led him to say that he can &quot; throw his licence above the table &quot; .
Moody , best known for his preparation of the unscrupulous master Black Caviar , described the race treatment rule as &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack was put on mud or clay on the horse horses , which was contrary to the rules .
&quot; It is against the rules of racing .
I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said .
&quot; One of my colleagues mistakenly put sludge on the leg .
It could have been that last night .
It could have been the same thing yesterday as it was .
It was also the same on the day of the race .
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the handling of the pack on the day of the race , and an investigation of this matter has been opened .
It is a joke .
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; We all recognise that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; Moody said .
Bicycle Bicycle
The police arrested a man after a gang of cyclists and then a flight of riders in Cobram .
The cyclist was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley-motorway .
The police said that the driver went on without stopping , to help the injured driver .
On Monday , a 50-year-old Nathalia man was in Shepparton .
It is expected to be charged for flight of passengers and for other forms of assistance and other traffic offences .
The cyclist , a 40-year-old man from Cobram , remains in hospital and is in a stable state .
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy is proposing to return against rivals for claims of war fighting .
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has criticized the tactics of his players as &quot; agenda-setup &quot; by two Premier League favourites of NRL .
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the storms players &quot; ring-fighting &quot; with his team during the high storming victory at the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hid comment on the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening , calling the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Rugby League and saying that the two from Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in the game .
Bellamy defended the beat of his team and said that they were concentrated in tackling only on their &quot; contact &quot; .
Bellamy added that the criticism of his team by two leading coaches is a source of confidence , because it means that they have been concerned about being defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; That keeps coming up - I did not hear Trent Robinson talking about martial fighting when she beat us 24 : 2 &quot; , said Bellamy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year round , but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real priority , and that has been the trend for us .
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train , so he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a little shock to him .
It is funny how this always appears at this time of year .
Bellamy attacked Bennett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his mentor that Bennett St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting the game was , &quot; said Bellamy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was criticised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of it .
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially its young players at their speed .
That is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they do .
I am building up more trust because they say these things because they are a little concerned about having to play against us .
Six weeks ago , they did not think of us when the big games were about .
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm against Roosters game has achieved a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys .
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game , I have not yet seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
Or are breaks and no points of interest ?
For me , it is the game plans .
When they mention us , it means that we will be meeting them in one phase .
The Storm team is free this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening at the AAMI Park , the ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning .
Serbians with $ 200,000 in cash on the counter
A man who is likely to face a life sentence for his attempt to get 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released for a bail of $ 200,000 .
Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the police found the drug 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay , which came from South America via Vanuatu and arrived in Coomera in August .
Maksimovic was seen how he met his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
Despite a possible life sentence for trying to have a commercial amount of cocaine , Maksimovic &apos;s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he had tried to have the whole amount and that the café could have been harmless .
The judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flanagan , was concerned about the danger of the flight of Macedonia at Maksimovic .
He has clear relations with Serbia .
He often travels to Serbia , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
In the criminal case he lied to the police about his whereabouts .
Maksimovic ’ s mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $ 200,000 as security to secure his release .
&quot; After reading the declarations of the two people , it is clear that the imposition of a security of USD 200 000 is a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flanagan .
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Maksimovic was released on bail , under the conditions that he gave away his Australian and Serbian passport , and was sent daily to the police and held a lock from 18 : 00 to 06 : 00 .
accident at A5 at Karlsruhe : Leading house strikes apart
On Tuesday evening , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening when a three lorry car accident on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe was being held .
Two of the three lorries involved had been holding back to Basel before a permanent construction site .
The third driver commented too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police said .
The accident causing the accident caused the accident .
The driver was severely injured in a hospital .
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was closed for six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
Damage amounting to EUR 122,000 was created .
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to attract paedophiles to send images .
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse .
Stevan Hogg took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , looped into an online messaging service , receiving a series of unrepentant images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg .
She saw it , found the summary messages and immediately alarmed her mother .
The police took care of this and looked at the five images , then analysed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for undecent images of children .
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done so , because it would lead to &quot; paedophiles on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pretended to be a policeman to frighten them &quot; .
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court : &quot; he said that it was a addiction - that he was addicted to frightening people .
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to frighten paedophiles .
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and asked him to send more photos .
He said that he did it to attract them .
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks , saying that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
Ms Robertson added : &quot; When the girl found the news on the phone , she shouted her mother and was on the street and on the wine .
She then saw the unspeakable images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who were much younger than he was .
Hogg , 23 , Ward Road , Dundee , has declared himself guilty of having committed to the infringement of the conditions on 25 January this year , in the sense of the indictment of having taken in inhumane pictures of children on 14 June of last year and not being presented to a hearing on 24 March this year .
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not appear in the register of sexual offenders , because it could be argued that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; is found in his crime .
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the judgment until October to receive background reports on social work .
Hogg was granted bail in this case , but was held in custody for hearings of other outstanding cases .
It was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment .
The smugglers are moving from small border crossings to Germany .
More and more refugees are being taken over from the major control points on the German-Austrian border .
Many smugglers , fearful of discovery and arrest , have increased the number of people on smaller border crossings .
on the Austrian side , a speaker from the Federal Police said .
Along the River Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken over in the Passau and Rottal-Inn districts since Tuesday .
They were walking over bridges and dams to the German side .
They are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
On the Munich Central Railway Station , far more refugees arrived after the weekend on Wednesday after the German police .
About 700 people arrived in the capital until 8 a.m. alone , said a spokesman in the morning .
On Tuesday , after the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border , 1759 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : Running Trips of Tropical Tower &quot; Henry &quot; in the South West is expected
Meteorologists warn of storm oars in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air is currently flooding into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DWD ) in Stuttgart .
The strong low is the outbreak of the &quot; Henry &quot; Tropic Tower , which has been dragging the Atlantic Ocean from the Bermuda Islands in recent days .
The sun is always warm and thunderstorms are expected , especially in Baden .
According to DWD , even in the Black Forest , on the Swabian Alb and in the Bodensee region , between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour may be expected until Thursday morning .
So on Friday , the sun will be able to look longer .
The mass is doing the job : every two years , the motorists at the IAA show their novelties .
In 2015 , the compact cars are moving in particular , and they are currently selling particularly well .
Compact car cars are currently particularly in demand : about 28.1 % of new registrations were made on this segment in August alone , according to the German Federal Office of the Federal Office of Transport and Tourism ( KBA ) .
This is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17-27 . September ) .
Many new compact models will be presented this year between all futuristic concept vehicles and new upper class cars and luxury cars .
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be present at the dealers in the autumn .
&quot; Astra is an extremely important model for us &quot; , said Opel chef Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair .
It is part of the brand .
In order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra should not become much more expensive for this either .
Opel is a sign of the biggest competition in VW Golf , which starts at € 17 650 .
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros .
The Astra is powered by a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
In addition , the Hessen is offering further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 hp , of which three-cylinder engines also count .
Unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only the fifth most important player .
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combi , which is already on the ILO .
And what will happen next to the IAA Astra ?
Renault Mégane : Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra-rival Mégane .
The Mégane is exclusively considered to be a fifth goal in a conventional and sporty GT version .
It comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then as a combi .
Infiniti : The new segment is the Infiniti Q30 .
The Nissan boom wants to find its position in the highly competitive segment with the new model .
The compact Infiniti , with its slim lines , fits perfectly into the brand ’ s line of design .
The basic model will have a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
The offer also includes a diesel diesel powered at 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Baleno : New in the segment is Suzuki Baleno , who celebrates his world premiere in Frankfurt .
The model is equipped with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
The maximum torque is based on the manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 Newton meters ( Nm ) .
The launch of Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : Not quite new , but completely renewed , is DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IAA .
The designer of the noble Citroën buyer placed his hand on the front end of the car : the cooling stove was redrawn and the modified headlights with LED technology were equipped with the new headlights .
The indoor interior has been modernised , the number of buttons has been reduced by a touchscreen and Apple ’ s carPlay has been integrated for the first time .
In addition , the IAA in the compact class includes a number of new versions and new variants such as the upgraded Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI .
JVA Berlin-Tegel : Five square meters cell are unworthy of human dignity .
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a legal opinion to an ex-detainee of the Tegel judicial service , which has been housed in a small tent for months .
Because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation in principle if they are housed in small cells .
The Federal Constitutional Court decided to do this in a decision published on Wednesday .
According to the judges , the people concerned can even hope for money if they were locked up in the narrow spaces ( Az . : 1 BvR 1127 / 14 ) .
This was a successful ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel judicial administration , and the toilet was not separated from the ground .
After that , the man who , according to his lawyer , is now back at liberty , was moved to a larger cell .
His detention was a failure , because of the undignified detention conditions imposed on the country of Berlin .
But the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and returned it to the matter for re-examination .
They are violating the human dignity of men .
Chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if , for legal reasons , the period in question is only a few days &apos; liability for compensation , a claim has been given , it has been said .
Otherwise , &apos; a scare &apos; of personality will be feared &apos; .
The Chamber of Chambers must now clarify the level of compensation .
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
They did not speak to a prisoner until April , because he was imprisoned in a cell .
According to a decision in 2011 , it is also unworthy of a decision to multiply a cell without separate toilet .
Furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had declared a person with a disgraceful appearance in a parallel case in November 2009 .
The then plaintiff was accommodated for three months , between 15 and 21 hours , in a similar cell , as in the case of Karlsruhe .
Berlin prisons have also been brought up in the news for lack of staff in recent weeks .
Prisoners are therefore kept locked up for 23 hours , increasing aggressiveness , even to be shocked because of the tense situation .
According to the judicial press office , 21 posts in tar are not filled because of lack of talent , 19 are to be abolished in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; We are creating the &quot;
Immigration is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What is Germany &apos;s position ?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year , according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) . Germany is even able to accept one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we create it &quot; .
What is to be done in Germany is the following overview .
According to different forecasts , between 350,000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400,000 ( estimate of the Pestle Institute ) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years .
That is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250,000 homes ) .
The lack of housing , however , is particularly dramatic in terms of affordable rental properties : 60 000 to 80,000 homes are excluded from the rental price every year , and these particularly advantageous housing will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister for Agriculture Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from the current EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion .
Too little is said about this from the Pest Institute : 80 000 housing housing should be created annually and the federal government should invest ECU 6.4 billion per year .
Scientists and the Federal Government also agree that there should also be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
The Institute for Employment Research estimates that 55 % of the population in Germany can work in the long term .
However , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started , Mr Walter , the project manager for integration and education , is critical of the Bertelsmann Foundation .
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the host society , but also for immigrants &apos; self-esteem , says Migration-Former Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany , according to Threshardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour to the recognition of work .
While there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the requirement for residence , which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence .
In society , the majority view - partly because of the shortage of skilled workers - has been that refugees should be given more rapid access to the labour market .
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge .
So far , there is not enough general and occupational language courses .
Research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
Thurhardt believes that the development of networks is the way to work with one another .
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few parents are giving their children their children , estimated at 10 to 15 % : &quot; For the uprooted parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Ilja Koschembar , Speaker of Youth and the Family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
In order to convince the family of the advantages of Kita , the administration distributes handlebars in different languages .
If the need for educators by the large number of refugees increases sharply , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example , by allowing more specialised schools .
In the countries , students are not taught in welcome classes in welcome classes .
They are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , says Beate Stoman of the Berlin School Administration .
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 % of refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or people from admittance - the only exception was Berlin , but Interior Senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned his position .
Student refugees could be given easier access to university .
After all , refugees with a residence stay or a residence allowance will receive no benefits under the asylum performance law if they start a study .
The latter do not receive any kind of brothel , since they do not fall within the scope of the people entitled to be entitled to do so .
Patients who have been detained have had to live four years in Germany to be Bafög-rightfully , and from 1 January 2016 this range has been reduced to 15 months .
This funding gap must also be closed , however , by Steffen Krach , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studentenwerk .
Students should be given immediate access to the pool .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as the churches , and develop the existing state church law into a new state of state religion .
It is also important to establish an Islamic charity , which will professionally take care of the new arrivals .
Rights also include obligations .
The representatives of Islam must therefore agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain opportunities to control .
This also includes a willingness to take a courageous stand against religious fundamentalism .
On Thursday , the chairman of the Muslim Central Council , Aiman Mazyek , expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
Those who wanted to deal with such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bayerischer Rundfunk .
He proposed that the constitution be translated into Arabic .
Integration will be much more a topic of society than it is today .
This will also mean that the majority society will have to change , and that discrimination and racism will be reduced .
Germany , as a result of European decisions , has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a brief decade .
But it is very slow to learn , as the NSU series of murders showed , in the police and the authorities systematically ignoring the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all : as far as migrants &apos; organisations and the interests of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and which international agreements such as the anti-racism convention are committing to Germany , in the coming years , if the country is to remain peaceful and to use its new citizens , for the good of
In general , Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far , says Minister of Health , Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
&quot; As for manpower and capacity , we create it , &quot; he said to the day .
However , additional money must be channelled into the system .
To avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery asks that all arrivals be handed health cards at the registration stage .
Services rendered could later be deducted from the Länder .
And , in the long term , it is highly questionable to leave so many people to the limited catalogue of services that the asylum performance law provides .
Otherwise , doctors will first of all create linguistic barriers .
As the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown , migrants are already being better informed about their diseases than other patients .
Not only clinics , but also doctors &apos; practices , require interpretation costs , which is what they are asking for .
Many refugees , however , would already have more general contact points in emergency ambulances .
And with a different diagnostic perspective .
Among the refugees , for example , there is a considerably more unequal disability , and there is an issue of HIV education among young people .
The fact that German doctors had their training in the other cases , but in some cases other illnesses , was clear , says Montgomery .
&quot; Parasitic attacks or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect &quot; and , as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned , the refugees may even be able to alleviate the situation .
The Syrians would have a sophisticated education system , and many refugees are even doctors .
In order to be able to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and , if necessary , re-examine them .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill , according to the Federal Psychiatric Vehicles Chamber ( BPtK ) : most suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression .
The refugee child is particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Munz , President of the BPD .
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany .
Those who are ill with post-traumatic stress problems suffer , among other things , from flash backs with respiratory , dizziness , heart attacks and death .
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , severe horror and emotional disobedience .
Munz explained that in order to prevent symptoms from becoming chronic , if it was necessary to treat early , it was necessary to do so .
So far , however , only four percent of the psychologically ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers in the social services can apply for psychotherapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
Moreover , in the social services , it is mostly the staff or doctors who are not trained for mental illness whether or not a therapy is necessary .
This often leads to misjudgments , says Munz .
Manege invites you to dream
The new staging of &quot; passion &quot; takes the Circus Probst back to the traditions of circus art .
The aim is to attract every age group into fascinating acrobatics , animal husbands and unique entertainment .
Now the Circus Probst invites to dream in the manege on the brick .
&quot; Our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my family of circus , &quot; says Stephanie Probst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; Passion &quot; - this is the motto of the current management staging .
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family .
The gift to the spirits is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; It is important to us that we should take people away from their everyday life and take them into another world for two hours , &quot; says the 27-year-old junior worker .
&quot; Manegencocktail with cosmopolitan flair &quot; , says Reinhard Probst , the director of the company .
50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometre long tour can now experience this flair .
The circus programme is convincing with talented artists from all over the world .
The Russian Stoliarov Clown Family is a member of the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , with jokes and charm .
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
With the heroes of the silent films , it wants to absorb the Cuban duo .
Lightness and mobility - these are the words they identify .
Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women herds in the storm .
Except for a lot of salmon salves , the acrobatics of Circus Probst also fascinates with a sense of sensitivity and joyfulness .
Balanced with the unicycle on a ball ?
There is no problem with Mr Yuan .
Snake men fascinate and frighten at the same time .
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics and is little more than a little bit fascinated by her agility .
Sixty employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; Animals belong to our family &quot; , emphasizes Stephanie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Probst .
The problems in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
Stephanie Probst also states that &quot; if our animals are not good , we will not do well either .
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stump unit .
The &quot; four-legged &quot; artists , as they are affectionately called , are read by the eyes whenever possible .
We want to work with animals and have fun with them .
If the animal does not feel good , it does not want to be in the manege either .
So the first thing to do is to ensure that animals are well protected .
The Probst family is proud of her Zebroid Jumbo , a mixture of ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastute .
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a single house and nothing has happened .
&quot; But then , suddenly , our little Jumbo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Probst .
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege , but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst .
So there is something for every visitor .
&quot; One thing is certain &quot; , says Stephanie Probst : &quot; No matter whether five or 1,200 spectators , we always do our best and are in full heart &quot; .
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. from 17th to 20th September .
On Sunday the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day , prices are reduced for the presentation at 5 p.m.
The animals show is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe ’ s Robert Mugabe is making a false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
It remained intact , but the video of the case quickly spread through the social media .
The opening of Parliament was also sour by allegations made by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them not to accompany Mr Mugabe &apos;s address with bugfixing .
Last month , they had buried him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - that is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change - MDC - Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to disrupt Mugabe &apos;s address .
&quot; The news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mugabe &apos;s speech .
It warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament will end and once they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective .
The Chief Prosecutor said that Morgan Tsvangirai &apos;s party was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers to politicians .
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce the number of jobs that are going to be paid for between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in the restructuring and savings efforts of the company ’ s services .
HP will split up later this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing corporate hardware and service activities .
The expected job losses are burdened by more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , as HP said in a statement .
&quot; These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise , &quot; said Meg Whitman , head of the HP-chair and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of deals that support companies in the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whitman .
As an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 + . $ year of turnover and &quot; will be concentrated on the provision of previously unmatched , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says one of the company &apos;s statements .
It divides a company founded in the 1930 ’ s by Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , graduates of the company , to produce electric equipment and their Palo Alto Garage man called &quot; the birthplace of Silicon Valley &quot; .
HP has undergone massive restructuring to overcome the shift away from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
The HP , the world ’ s second-largest PC producer and one of the largest American tech companies , is the latest in this area , which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better .
FC Arsenal-Kapur Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind the disgraceful Jack Wilshere before playing against Dynamo Zagreb .
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and that , if his rehabilitation proceeds by plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that poaching will certainly miss the next four games for England and , given his history , his participation next summer will surely be uncertain at the European Championship .
The great shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had brought a very close end to the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old momentum during the preceding season .
&quot; This kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; Wenger said .
It is a bone that did not heal well .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not connected with his ankle or the injuries he had before .
This may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wenger also acknowledged , there is a risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
It is also developing an unpleasant pattern .
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of wilderness since its debut six years ago .
He also played in only 65 of the 15 players in the last five seasons .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight games since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most injury days .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season .
&quot; Sometimes , when you return to a violation , you have a fragile period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win martial arts , &quot; Wenger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body will stabilise , I am confident that he will do so and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal starts his championship league season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur will be opposing Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , and Wenger is going to press a
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
&quot; I am trying to keep the balance and to allow the players who need a little bit of swing , &quot; Wenger said .
Although Arsenal is clearly a favourite to move forward through Group F , the Maksimir-Stadion in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating players in Europe .
Dynamo is also unscrupulous after 41 games after the &quot; untouchable &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3.2 points on the Richter scale .
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson of the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management .
&quot; This drive is immense , &quot; Wenger said .
Arsenal has never worked .
We were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough in business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .
FriendsFest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friendships .
The absence of similar representations in shows is evident , especially in view of how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15-year high .
In 2013 , it was the main cause of death in the UK , aged 20-45 , and it remains three times more common for men than for women .
In an effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - Campaign Against Poverty Life ) annulled 2015 as the Year of Man , with the aim of calling into question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Friendship is the heart of the fight to meet this challenge .
A recent study by more than 2,000 high-school pupils with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had enough of a healthy percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; , his chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems .
But , of course , we have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
In the age of communication via social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to be strong , vital and successful , even if in reality isolation is dominant .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intrinsically intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship , which has a much deeper effect on our mental health .
And , as a video game inventor and billionaire recently said , money really cannot buy luck .
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned upside down .
Each character was defined not by his work but by his personality , which was shining through interaction as a friend .
The humour of Joey and Chandler frequent embrace , moments at football matches in cozy armchairs and the longing from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can certainly refer to it , even though they often refuse to fully experience their feelings .
As a telephone company employee told me , ... &quot; my audience for people who feel depressed and suicidal has really demonstrated me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
The men who contact us often do not feel able to speak to friends .
The old saying &apos; I am right to do so &apos; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &apos;
Friends is one of the shows that I have in mind when trying to offer more long-term solutions .
It is a very clear presentation of the small moments of men ’ s friendships .
However much my objective outsider status via telephone might help people in times of despair , long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so , if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to drink in Central Perk ?
Or , better still , if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks , give him a smile and tell him hello .
We never know what difference you could make .
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the total 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest .
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmö .
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani following his hit against Malmö .
Di Maria is in the champions &apos; league on Tuesday and helps PSG to move to Malmö .
Here is the game review and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani followed suit when Paris Saint-Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday .
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his champions &apos; league debutant as a PSG player , who brought the French champion to the road , but afterwards they missed a series of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani reached a head ballhead at 61 minutes .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetk in group A , too , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , because they are not only seeking the qualifications for the K.O. rounds , but also an improvement on the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they were getting the points , Laurent Blancs &apos; team was not a match for the missed opportunity to play with Zlatan Ibrahimovics , who was later replaced by his home town team and the club with which he started his illustrious career in 1999 .
&quot; It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems for our opponents and look back in a relaxed way , even if there are certain things we still need to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; That is a good sign .
We wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved another or two goals . &apos;
After being injured , Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris-Team in one of three amendments , which at the weekend managed to keep a 2 : 2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was kicked out by Di Maria in the fourth
The Argentine wing stormer was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month and he indicated why , when he went into the basement of Marco Verrattis , before he left Johan Wiland , he left the long corner of the net .
If , however , anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , it was disappointing .
Malmö , who beat Celtic in a play off to reach this stage , joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent of a five-man defence and two deep in the middle .
But , apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who went far to Kevin Trapps ’ s post in the 34 minute , they did not offer much .
Instead , PSG itself sometimes stood up , with some faults and bad qualifications , not least Ibrahimovic , who was patrolled in the first half on no less than five trials and then abandoned after Cavani had used him after the restart .
Nevertheless , he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the field , and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic , who transformed Di Maria into a shooting shot , which was led by Wiland in the 52 minute ...
The second goal finally fell short after the hour of the hour thanks to Cavani , who achieved the sixth season of the Uruguay after Ibrahimovic had been fishing a left-wing flank of Maxwell .
This ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game and only an excellent windfall intervention from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before replacing a gate with Ezequiel Lavezzi .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , later admitted that PSG played a class over his team , and the Norwegians said : &quot; Our last championship league game was last year .
Since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level of standards .
Qualifications games are not enough . &apos;
Hats off before Paris !
It was a great game of them !
Glencore collects $ 2.5 billion through share sales
The Glencore mining giant , based in Switzerland , which is hit by a drop in commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling it as part of its massive debt collection plan .
Glencore , registered in London , stated in a statement that it sold around $ 1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its own debt .
The company , which has lost 57 % of its market this year , is fighting with falling commodity prices , as China ’ s economic slowdown is pushing demand and is having a devastating effect on markets .
The issue of benchmark rights brought Glencores stock price to the top of the London stock market early on Wednesday morning .
The share was 2.77 % , 131.60 par , on the FTSE 100 index , which increased 0.69 % .
GlenCore announced last week the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to eradicate roughly one third of its $ 30 billion .
The company sold 125 par per share to new shares , which meant a 2.4 % discount on the final price on Tuesday .
There were 1.3 billion shares worth 9.99 % of the group .
Concerns over long-term sustained growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper , and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 % to 40 % .

The White House confirms Xi Jinping ’ s visit to Washington .
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month , confirming the White House in a statement on Tuesday .
The visit , Xi ’ s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and replies to President Barack Obama ’ s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosting both Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan this evening with a state dinner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks .
&quot; President Xi &apos;s visit will provide an opportunity to broaden US-China cooperation on a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to tackle areas of disagreement constructively , &quot; adds the statement .
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before he goes on to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a number of contentious issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns about China &apos;s alleged cyberspiral scare and its growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .
440-PS-Sportcars borrowed and driven to scrap .

Xavi : Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008 .
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015 .
The FC Bayern apparently stood a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s superstar , Xavi , who played for the FC Barcelona .
Eight times Spanish champions , three times the Cup , four times Champions League victories , two times Club World Champion , two times European champions , a World Champion once - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking .
In the summer the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-S-add sport club in Qatar .
But Xavi is now telling us that he was already in an interview with Marca , before he left Barcelona before the 2008 European Championships .
&quot; They told me that Barça wanted me to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything , we nothing , &quot; he says .
And that was also registered by the FC Bayern .
Xavi : &quot; There was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rummenigge wanted me . &quot;
As a reminder , in summer 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardiola was the reason why Xavi did not change
The change did not materialise .
The decisive man for this work is working for the German record master today : Pep Guardiola .
Xavi explains why : &quot; Barça has taken out Guardiola and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; Pep told me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; He has cheered me with that . &quot;
Who knows how Bayerns was running Xavi 2008 / 2009 .
Xavi stood for Barca in the Champions League quarter-final against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , switched off the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and finally celebrated the Royal Clock triumph .
Matt Damon plays a variety of films and movies .
Matt Damon confronted the Afro-American film director , Mr Effie Brown , during a debate on diversity , saying that she would not need behind the scenes .
During a follow-up to Sunday Night by HBO Project Greenlight , the experienced actor Brown broke down when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project ’ s chosen script .
&quot; When we talk about diversity , you do it in the occupation of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; Damon assured .
Brown reacted shocked , with insulted disbelief and called &quot; Hoo ! ! Okay &quot; when the comments of The Martian actor were stifled .
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the show finalists .
&quot; I would like to call on people to think about this - whoever will be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown said .
The only black person , and she is a nut beaten by her white pimp .
Dear White People &apos;s producer argued for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to the right of the film ; Damon replied that &quot; at the end of the day we could give something that we do not want . &quot;
After the debate was broadcast , the social media exploded before complaining about Damon &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing &quot; Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WEISS that hurts &quot; .
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retaets and 4,000 likes since its release .
Damon &apos;s comments come at a time when the media &apos;s exact representation in the media is at the top of the social debate .
After the teens killed Michael Brown in 2014 by a white policeman , Black Lives Matter ’ s movement took effect nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against paint .
In February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominees of the year at the Grammy Awards .
&quot; Albums quietmatter &quot; ( albums still matter ) he said .
Like books and black lives , old people still have their meaning .
More recently , leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have issued a statement in response to the question of the Fox-News-designate Elisabeth Hasselbeck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; The Black Lives Matter network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
Recently , it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers , producers and media mogul who would be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;American Ninja Warrior &apos; crowned first champion Champion
The first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million was the first athlete to become a professional athlete and assistant .
The competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
During the season , two men , Caldiero and Cameroon Geoff Britten , managed to get into the final .
The last task was climbing at a 75 feet climbing rope in 30 seconds .
He finished his job within the time he was the first athlete to complete the tough Phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior , but Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Caldiero spoke to E ! News after the hard-won victory , still under the shock of the $ 1 million win of the Grand Prix .
&quot; I think it is amazing to think about the fact that I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; said Isaac E , about his pile of money .
So suddenly .. like I can not even imagine what this is ... the future is unknown .
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why , although he ended up ending up with the course , he did not receive any prize money .
The rules are the ones that are the fastest person .
&quot; If there are more than one finalist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; said Weed .
How much money is a wonderful prize and changes life , it gets the great free registration .
I do not think he has any resentment about this .
He has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
He was awarded by many awards from fans .
He is such a great guy and a family father .
He is a hero of his children and his wife .
Geoff said to me : &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
I think that Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a period of eight years , and the shooting will begin in early 2016 .
Detroit Tiger &apos;s wings are over Minnesota Twins &apos;
MINNEAPOLIC - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tiger .
Once they were one of the best teams in the baseball , today the Tigers are in the final rank in the American League Central .
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field .
The Twins spared an opportunity to climb within a small container of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard course .
Detroit , albeit for one evening , was a return to the three letters F-word , which was so difficult to take over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; All victories do fun , no matter how it comes &quot; , said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus .
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit punctuated three times in the first two innings , then in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13-9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Innings and allowed three runs .
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year very much , &quot; Simon said .
It is difficult to throw every game in the bullpen , so I want to go into the game in a very focused way .
The designated driver Victor Martinez had three hit and was in two rounds , his first RBIs since mid-August .
It was Martinez ’ s first three hit game ever since he had four hit against Seattle Mariners on 6 July .
&quot; He has swung the wood wood well , &quot; said Ausmus .
He looked good at ( drumming ) training , he looked much better in the bullpen and he brought it directly into the game .
With three rounds in the rear at the end of the seventh inner campaign , the Twins had their best chance of coming back into the game .
Center Field Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left .
Right Fields Aaron Hicks reached a bunker and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the Strikeout before being replaced by the Linkshield Blaine Hardy .
Hardy &apos;s overrun wall , the only man he faced , was faced by the designer , the robotic drummer Miguel Sano , who took away the right-wing Drew Verhagen from a tevo-run .
With a pair of runners and the lap run at the second , the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe was taken to a double play .
It was the leading 27 in the Major League , and the season was a double play .
After Detroit added an Insurance-Run at the end of the insurance-run , Wall created a RBI double against the Closer of Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4 .
The right-wing , however , has been running Sano for three pitches for his fifth SGP .
Detroit benefited from the game of a still unmanageable Phil Hughes .
The Tigers reached three rings in the first two innings against the right-wing veteran , who had been removed from the list of injuries before the match , after having lost more than a month because of a back-row .
&quot; Obviously not the beginning I had hoped for , &quot; Hughes said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I got off and felt that I would create some fairly good pitches in the third inept &quot; .
After receiving the lead offender , Hushard gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler .
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game , creating a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Martinez has been managing his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position .
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed a single on the right , created another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
The Tigers beat the second , a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single from Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0 .
&quot; That was a big blow , &quot; said Twins-Manager Paul Molitor .
He did not beat out very well , but he caught the right place .
Hughes was in a pitch countdown , did not score points in the third suit before being replaced by the Reverant Legislator A.J.Achter .
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a four strikeouts .
NOTE : Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez differed because of a violation of the custodian .
He is being investigated by Dr James Andrews , who was the servant of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid-August on the injury list because of a school breakdown , is due to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
With Sanchez , LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the injury list to start the Twins .
Norris with 1-1 at four start-ups with the Tigers , since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July .
He has been absent since 20 August because of a distortion in the right hip .
The Tigers and Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday .
Norris ( 2-2,4,43 ERA ) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana ( 5-4 , 4.73 ) .
Hundreds of refugees are to be lost in Wiesbaden .
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen .
His arrival was expected on Wednesday night .
The people who arrive there should be housed in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden told us on Tuesday evening .
They were in the region of 450 to 750 refugees .
Several sports halls in the state capital of Hesse were prepared for this case in recent days .
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily displaced there .
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
In the last ten days alone , 7500 people arrived in Hessen , according to the Governing Council of Gießen , responsible for the first time .
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Ischinger : German military action in Syria
The head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Ischinger , believes that military action with German participation in Syria is a possibility .
&quot; I believe that the decisive consideration of military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
He has called on the European states to &apos; look at collective ways &apos; .
Four years ago , we were pleased that the Kelch had passed away with military participation in Germany .
&quot; Now the conflict is dragging on our doorstep , &quot; he said in German radio .
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls at the southern and eastern borders
Austria has also introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian interior minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF that no one is being returned to Hungary .
Germany , too , did not send refugees back to Austria .
&apos;No , it is agreed , &apos; she said .
On the question of an agreement whereby Germany could absorb a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mikl-Leitner said that there have already been discussions on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
She did not call specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
In recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary .
Their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had begun to carry out temporary border controls on Sunday .
The EU Member States have not yet been able to agree on a joint approach to the crisis .
The EU Home Affairs Ministers want to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees on a special meeting this coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
In view of the strong refugee situation in Germany , the Federal Government wants to give more support to countries in the first instance and to distribute people .
The federal government will manage this together with the countries , and Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four weeks of deliberations with the Prime Minister at the Berlin Chancellery .
Merkel underlined that those people who needed protection would also have it .
But if you do not have a lead perspective , you cannot stay in Germany either .
This view was strongly divided in the round .
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now manage to &apos; a huge effort &apos; .
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
A few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence .
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smugglers from seeking evasions over Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister , Peter Szijjarto , on the planned new border barrier .
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan .
There were first arrests of people who had reached the fence .
In Turkey , however , witnesses have shown that thousands more migrants are on their way to Greece &apos;s border .
Space sonde &quot; Cassini &quot; finds ocean on Saturnmoon Enceladus
Under the ice panzer of Saturnmont Enceladus , a global ocean is swapping .
This includes researchers from space explorers &apos; Cassini &apos; .
The moon is therefore easily swung on its way around the ring planets .
This movement is small but too large for a permanent , solid celestial body , that is , a statement by the Cornell University in Ithaca ( United States State New York ) on Tuesday .
Researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; Icarus &quot; .
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the Enceladus ice sheet .
In 2006 , Cassini discovered ice vulcanes on the southern pole of Saturnmont , which sped water vapour and ice particles , feeding the so-called E Ring of Saturn .
At least at the South Pole , there was a need for an underground sea , and astronomers closed down then .
The expansion of the hidden oceans was not clarified , however .
Rama 1860 Munich has been missing several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up a month on offensive actor Valdet Rama .
An investigation has revealed an infant injury in the 27-year-old , the association said .
Rama complained about pain earlier this week .
According to Munich lions , diagnosis is supposed to mean four weeks of forced rest .
&quot; That is hard for us , Rama is a bitter loss . &quot;
&quot; Of course we must think now , &quot; said Sports Director Necat Aygün of the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unifying professional .
As a training guest , the Sixties initially presented a defensive .
The 30 year-old Hrvoje Cale was active in Belgium and was previously a member of the VfL Wolfsburg .
The Croats are currently &apos; able to prove their ability &apos; .
Torah ’ s Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brainwashing next week .
The Austrian national player is due to start training as early as Thursday .
Okotie was injured in a violent clash in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
However , contrary to initial fears , he remained without a serious blinking .
No Diets Fruits - Mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet .
But those who want to be careful about its lean line are often more likely to be left out of it .
Mangoes contain relatively high sugar , above all sucrose .
The exotic fruits are still healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C , but , above all , mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta carbotin .
Those who eat the fruits will therefore support their visual , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
When buying , mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
The shade colour alone does not tell you how mature the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very delicious .
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
Then they taste pure or sweet in the kitchen .
A mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes .
It is a milder taste of the slightly bitter taste of some of the leaves such as Chicoree and Radiccio .
And a mango chutney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
The US package service UPS is again providing 95,000 grants for the Christmas business in the United States .
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers , announced UPS on Tuesday .
Drivers are mainly looking for drivers .
Last year , UPS had increased its workforce by 95,000 to 2007 in the holiday season .
In the face of booming online business , UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements for Christmas business since the last year .
In 2013 , the package services had been severely criticized for their supply .
First Föhn Storm , then a prominent cold front
Next night , the Föhn valleys are breaking up in the valleys of the Alpine ground side , as Meteoschweiz informed on Tuesday .
On Wednesday and on Thursday night , the Föhn blows partly with storm strength from the females .
After the Christmas morning , a striking cold front crosses us , bringing heavy rainfall , wind and a temperature drop .
As MeteoNews writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast underground area across the British Isles , in a strong south-west stream .
On the Alpine ground side , the Föhn falls through the valleys during the night .
As a result , the Föhn blows up until Thursday morning in the females with floors of 60 to 100 km / h , and in the Urnerland in particular , even with over 100 km / h .
The föhn can penetrate the surrounding middle and the mountains can even be reached by more than 120 km / h on the mountains .
While in the north , on Wednesday , stormy fumes for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture on the almond snow begins to dust .
Here is rain , which lasts until Thursday evening .
In total , in the next 48 hours , the southern Alps will have to be counted in some cases over 100 litres per square metre , which has already fallen in the last few days .
On Thursday morning , the air is running out of the fattening , and a cold front is rolling out with a strong , partly weighted rain from the West to the East over Switzerland .
Together with the cold front , the wind is very strong to the storm , and temperatures are falling significantly .
The following days are in the north , from 15 to 20 degrees , but in the south it is sunniest and warmer at the weekend , up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation , Rome now has a Martin-Luther place .
In the presence of the city president Ignateau o Marino , an unnamed square in the park on the Oppia Hill was baptized on Wednesday on behalf of the German reformer .
In the Piazza Martin Lutero , he is now recognised as the &quot; German theologian of the Reformation &quot; .
The park is located in the heart of ancient Rome , next to the Colosseum .
The name was requested by the Protestant Church of Rome in Rome .
Jens-Martin Kruse , the pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes could often live their faith in secret for centuries as a minority .
Square will be symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 1483-1546 ) , a young Augustinian painter , spent a few months in Rome at the turn of the century , in 1510 / 11 .
He then found the city as a lost scapegoat .
His negative impressions may have been reinforced by historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then had begun to split the abbey church with his ideas against the deregulation of the trade .
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold-plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated bible texts .
At the beginning was the word ?
No , not the Otmar-Alt-Bible , which has now been published with magnificent pictures .
At the beginning , the picture was painted by Otmar Alt , who formulated in 150 motifs his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
His &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is not necessarily synonymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
On the contrary , it can be quite dire in adapting to the subjects concerned .
For about three years , Otmar Alt has worked on his bible project , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books .
Cycles are emerging , which address issues such as crossroads , plagues , bids or fatherhood .
He has spontaneously fascinated several partners : the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation and the Kettler publishing house , which focuses on art books .
And there is the author Klaus Altepost , who has been dealing with the respective biblical places on the basis of painting .
He has interpreted the biblical sites selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated it into current contexts .
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old painting .
They are embedded in the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one by one by the artist , who expresses his personal thoughts on the situation in this case .
The jewelry is gold .
The 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high degree of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately the cause of the Bible project : Otmar Alt , born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant ruler order .
&quot; The education has already been done with the pipes &quot; , says Otmar Alt .
&quot; I tried to work on that , so perhaps I could also return to the Lord .
His second concern is to restore the importance of art to art in a very short space of time : &quot; The perception of images is now marked by advertising , and that is loud .
Symbolism is dispensed with .
Artists have a different desire and rage to show things .
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; In this respect , I am a dinosaur .
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to be &quot; fallen in the picture &quot; , to let her work , to discover and to feel the force she has : &quot; The image is looking for his opposite &quot; .
On Tuesday , Klaus Altepost stood up at the Otmar Christmas Foundation &apos;s presentation of the Otmar Alt-Bible , &quot; always &quot; a fan of Otmar Alts &apos; art : &quot; I like to see life with his paintings &quot; .
Alt did not pay attention to the whole of the Bible , but to the subjects that are important to him , including mysterious ones .
&quot; That was not cooperation on eye level , &quot; says Altepost : &quot; This is about the pictures , the text only explains &quot; .
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; deepen his life and find freedom &quot; .
Otmar Alts ’ pictures speak for mobs both of the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
Part of the original - paper and painting - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otto-Alt-Stiftung .
The start of construction for the BMX-Bahn is approaching .
Plans , place , place , contracted companies , modeled ground for a round course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BMX train , this was already over .
Policies and administrative omissions have caused a loss , especially among those who have not wanted to tolerate the train .
So , it is a question of closing hills , looking for new places - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
The approval will be received in October , the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock has now been informed in the Committee on Children &apos;s Rights and the Committee on Youth .
&quot; I hope that this year will still be visible , &quot; she said .
It should then be started without a &apos; more pause &apos; for the former indoor pool .
DFB intensifies the commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundesliga is sending out a clear signal at the weekend .
Football is responding to the growing situation in Germany and is helping policymakers to deal with the problems that are facing us .
&quot; I believe that this is the greatest challenge of our country since reunification . &quot;
&quot; In principle , no one can say that I am not interested in this , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; This must be of interest to everyone to get to grips with this issue , &quot; said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach .
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; I am in the office of governors next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; This is certainly a key issue , &quot; he announced .
Football can and may want to help .
Politics must take the decisive steps .
The German Football Federation therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; We have ensured through the Egidio -Braun-Stiftung that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; said Niersbach on the fringes of the UEFA meeting in St Julian &apos;s / Malta .
Some of the federal leftists also support this programme .
This weekend , the 36 professional associations are sending a clear signal if they will wear the printed &quot; We help - # lifereswelcome &quot; on the left tricot instead of the usual sponsorship logo .
&quot; We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Leverkusen &apos;s sports director Rudi Völler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &apos; self-evident &apos; .
&quot; The tragedy of refugees is of concern to everyone , and nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; We football federals can , no , we must use our radiance , our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbelievably , &quot; said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz .
Hoffenheim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a &quot; prominent league sign &quot; .
On this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale for the EM Qualification Game against Hungary .
Niersbach called support for refugees &apos; a large community of German football &apos; .
It is great that all 36 licence clubs in their places have started their own projects .
It is equally great that small and smallest clubs are active .
The message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we have spent is being lived in football .
&quot; That is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
This year and next year , the Association , together with the DFB selection and the German Government , will each make available EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees .
&quot; The clubs have already taken up the whole of the 2015 budget &quot; , said Niersbach .
Reports : SAP chief executive loses sight of an eye when the accident occurs .
The head of the European top software company , Bill McDermott , has said that a fall in the eye has left the left eye behind several reports .
In the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the United States , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; He is almost verbally impassed , powerless , then he left the road - he told us this last week &quot; , quotes the &quot; Wiwo &quot; SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner .
McDermott could do his job .
&quot; At the beginning of October , we meet in Walldorf before the meeting of the Supervisory Board , &quot; said Plattner .
The 54 year-old manager was present at the meeting and &quot; fully functional &quot; .
McDermott announced in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung ( Thursday edition ) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I am fully in favour of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; Of course , I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Hasso Plattner , all this time , &quot; said McDermott of the SZ .
McDermott usually trains between Germany and the USA , but since summer he has not been at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf .
He thought it important to go to the public with such a personal history , said the manager of the &quot; SZ &quot; : &quot; Everyone can do this . &quot;
&apos;It is important to stand up again when you fall down . &apos;
McLaren-replacement pilot Magnussen ...
Magnussen twittered a photo and said he had suffered the injury when he was overthrown by the wheel .
He therefore does not question the two stumbling masters Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the weekend at night in Singapore , as he does a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
Football : BVB without Reus against Krasnodar : White coat in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund , all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus have finally been broken in the first group game of the Europe League .
The national player will also be missing the Cup leader of the football federation in Duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; Unfortunately , we cannot use it , &quot; said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday .
The BVB-coach has openly admitted that Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen . &quot; We expect him to return to the training on Friday &quot; .
Given the high pressure on his professionals , Tuchel will not only change his stall on the Reus position .
He announced a change on the Tornado position .
That is why Roman Weidenfeller is taking up the place of the German regular keeper Roman Bürki .
&quot; He trains at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the World Champion of football .
However , Tuchel did not let the white sheep be used in all Europa League games in the future .
It is likely that he will also be able to deny the second .
The forceful statement made by Mitspieler Reus that the final suit for the BVB in Europe &apos;s League should be the goal , says Central Field player Julian Weigl as a logical conclusion : &quot; This is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance of getting the title off . &quot;
Robotics &apos; cars : Government wants to lead Germany
Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the direction of the German Government &apos;s desire to change the car .
On Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Ministers Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure , among other things .
Dobrindt spoke of a &quot; new mobility age &quot; on Wednesday &apos;s fringe of the IAA Automotive .
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion , as Dobrindt said .
He also wants to discuss this with his colleagues from the G7 countries , who are also meeting representatives of industry at the IAA .
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasises , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband and rapid transition to digital radio .
A test line is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
In order to &apos; avoid any additional liability risks &apos; , the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and adapt it to new developments where necessary . &apos;
Germany , for example , wants to make an effort internationally to increase the permitted speed of self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
The Federal Government also wants to see the Vienna Convention amended , which until now has only been envisaged for people as drivers .
Automated driving is increasingly taking the car to the top , and the driver becomes more and more passengers .
The technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020 .
Yet , vehicles on public roads are not &apos; expected to wait until 2020 &apos; .
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate that the authors of the study will be worth about EUR 8.4 billion for 2025 .
&quot; The digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; said the SPD transport politician , Sören Bartol .
However , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the drivers &apos; personal data must be clearly clarified .
Yet the Germans still see themselves as sceptical - much more than French or Americans .
A survey by the Forsa-Institute presented on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the Prüm Convention concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that cars that are self-driving will prevail over the next ten years , 32 % expect only 20 years , 31 % do not believe it at all .
In France , 21 % of the population is expected to fly with autonom cars by 2025 , while the United States has 33 % .
In any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self-driving vehicle .
According to a survey conducted by the Bitkom digital association , only seven per cent would agree to hand over control throughout the journey on all roads .
On the motorway , this could well be 15 % in the case of flowing traffic , while in traffic 45 % .
Well , every fourth person would not leave control under any circumstances to the car .
Boll says goodbye to Team and Double Start at Table Tennis-EM .
The Düsseldorf wants to be the only one to hit the nail in the balance , as it stands at present in the titles battles between 25 September and 4 October .
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest .
&quot; That is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; The boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; We are strong enough , however , even without Timo , &quot; said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM training course in Düsseldorf .
Boll was on the plane at that time to a long-term agreed sponsorship in China .
The 34 year-old German Champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; Without timing , the disadvantage is that we are no longer so clear a favorite &quot; , said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov .
The hammer , who runs the betting list in Yekaterinburg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Schwechat .
&quot; Timo also missed that , and we have become European champions . &quot;
&quot; We should be guided by this , &quot; declared the world rankings .
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right foot .
At the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven , the defender was hit by a Tackling by Héctor Moreno and was replaced after long treatment .
The first diagnosis suggested that the 20-year-old former Gypsy player was a ski-crack .
Gaultier feels old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figurine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
The highlights : window windows that look awfully human thanks to video projections .
They are the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , has become the great star of the fashion scene , including Madonna stage outfits - and with the fact that he has put men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the grandson of Haute Couture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; It used to be a bit light , it is now real , &quot; Gaultier said .
For the visitors of the exhibition From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk ( From the Cloud to the Runway ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung from 18 September , it is fortunate that the moenologist has changed his initial negative attitude to a show of his person .
He was actually opposed to it , because : &quot; An exhibition sounded a bit after death &quot; , he said .
When you die , you get to the museum .
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris .
&quot; It is about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Diederen .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man , which is hardly too distant , and which has written fashion history without ever having completed an education .
The show is not built chronologically , but it is an excellently choreographed total art work , for which a great deal of work has been done : to freeze the dolls , for example , a stylist has been dedicated , for
The makers , according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot , have carved 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
Shortly before the Oktoberfest was started , a special hint of leather was added : a leather top outfit with a corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
He always wanted strong women ( &quot; women are smarter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaultier said .
Gaultiers of old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition .
He stands for the designer ’ s first tentative fashionable approach .
As a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he used his teddy belt and clothes , Gaultier .
Playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to do so .
He later taught himself fashion .
He was a member of the German Society for the Arts and Design of the Arts and Design of the Arts and Design of the Arts .
Later I bought it , of course .
He was not able to pay for his first fashion show .
They did not get anything , but they could keep the clothes .
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener spitze as Mode-Nic
In the past , the long dripping machines in and around Plauen were about to be made meters .
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in great numbers for customers who , for example , continued to process them in blankets and gardhouses .
That alone is no longer working today , explains Andreas Reinhardt , Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen .
Instead , fashion is important .
Fashion played a greater role in the early days of the Plauener peak , then pushed out by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt calls a number of examples : top in jewellery , accessories , bags and regional costumes .
In general , the so-called vintage fashion , which is based on past stilettos , is increasing the number of orders .
Those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
We already have half of all contracts with us .
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener spitze and embroidery , together with nine other companies .
Only they can wear the protected label .
In the last 15 years , around 80 % of turnover has been broken .
Private traders and wholesale trade are almost no longer in place .
Our products are hardly reaching our customers .
Today , the bulk of the mass is produced in Asia much cheaper and is sold almost exclusively via chains .
Moreover , exports are currently weakening , currently in Russia and the United States .
So there are reasons for new ways .
The industry association is also trying to highlight , through environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein said : &quot; This year we have been conducting a quality label which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible .
Reinhardt adds : &quot; This also applies to the materials used &quot; .
Diploma designate Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg external window of the West Saxon School of Applied Arts Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialised in embroidery and
To counter competition from the Asian region , we need to find high-quality and innovative products .
It takes time and courage .
There is a tension between the most recent ideas of designers and the companies that have to think primarily economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
A few years ago textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak .
The machine sticks small cows at some places .
The Plauener goldsmither-in-the-wool Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by the fact that &quot; before I could not start with traditional pollen . &quot;
Now she uses the tip of the snow for her jewelry .
In an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; Many people in the region identify with the subject of Plauener Berg - young and old , &quot; Reuter says .
It also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and its surroundings and who want to be remembered .
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Plauener Peak .
Disney is planning to release Mary Poppins &apos; movie
It is not a matter of sticking to legends , but Disney nonetheless dares to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary Poppins &quot; .
But , according to Entertainment Weekly , this is not a refilming , but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl .
It is the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
Anyone who plays Poppins for over 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear .
But the director is already aware of Rob Marshall , the last of whom is &quot; Into the Woods &quot; in the cinema .
Xi urges the economy to be opened up to the world .
The economy must be opened up to the outside world in order to promote growth , as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group charged with guiding reform .
&quot; China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve the strategies for starting up business , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group on the need to deepen a comprehensive reform .
Promoting new ones and promoting reforms will bring renewed momentum and vitality and provide new opportunities for economic growth , Xi .
The leadership has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list of market access rules , relaxation of border control policy , promotion of SOEs , private capital , and overhaul of the one-of-a-kind system of registration .
The statement creates a negative list identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
The system is being tested gradually and improved by test programs .
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources , guaranteeing a legal business environment and making the market more open , as the statement said .
The government will also ease controls on the powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business .
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
In the context of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors , further areas are being opened up for private investment .
&quot; The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
Moreover , it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the green card by optimising requirements and facilitating the application process .
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting .
At the meeting , Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
The EU wants to double mercury limit values in predatory fish .
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and thus to give consumers a much higher dose of nerve cancer .
The consumer organisation Foodwatch , which has a suitable EU working paper , has been sharply critical of the plans : &quot; Risks and side-effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy are passed on to pregnant women and infants &quot; , said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch .
According to Wolfschmidt , the limit of the nerve toxin for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as hay or swordfish , for &apos; economic policy reasons &apos; , is to be raised from one milligram of mercury per
However , large predators are already weighed so heavily with mercury that , on the basis of the remaining limit values , about 50 % of the catches must not be sold .
After doubling the limit values , only 14.5 % would be illicit .
In exchange for this relaxation , the EU , according to Foodwatch , wants to tighten up the limit values for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
However , Foodwatch called this a &apos; trick &apos; because smaller grains , such as carp , are usually so low that they are already meeting the planned maximum levels .
The reduction in small fish is therefore &apos; a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone &apos; , says Wolfgang Schmidt .
Mercury is a heavy metal highly toxic to humans , and it is highly enriched by the food chain , especially in predatory fish .
The Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; small amounts of damage to the nervous system , especially in the case of unborn children , &quot; can cause damage to the nervous system .
The Federal Environment Ministry , however , states on its homepage that the &apos; health hazard of the general public &apos; is not to be expected in view of the current maximum levels .
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal burning .
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal-fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mercury annually , two thirds of the total produced in Germany , according to the German Federal Ministry for the Environment , Public Health and
The concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube was &quot; permanently and comprehensively exceeded &quot; , the &quot; mirror &quot; had quoted from the paper in March .
Last year , Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were among the most common health risks reported in the EU alert system RASFF .
Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest against EU plans at www.qumerber-aktion.foodwatch.de .
